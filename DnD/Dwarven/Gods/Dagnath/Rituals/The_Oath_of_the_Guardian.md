# The Oath of the Guardian

## Description
The Oath of the Guardian is a revered ceremony where dwarves swear to protect the knowledge and relics of their ancestors. This ritual is held in the Hall of Echoes, a sacred chamber where the voices of past guardians resonate in the stone. The hall is lit by torches that cast a warm, steady glow, symbolizing the eternal vigilance required of a Guardian.

## Chant
The chant for The Oath of the Guardian is a solemn vow, recited in a deep, resonant tone that fills the chamber:

"In the heart of the hills, our promise we bind,
The past to preserve, the future to find.
With hammer and will, our oath we forge,
To guard the halls, our sacred charge."


## Role
The Warden of the Past is the central figure in this ceremony, a dwarf of honor and strength who oversees the swearing of the oaths. It is the Warden who administers the vows and blesses the new guardians, ensuring they understand the gravity of their commitment.

## Insignia
The Warden of the Past wears a medallion that bears the emblem of the 'Eternal Shield', a symbol of unyielding defense and protection. This insignia is typically forged from gold and iron, representing both the value and the strength of the guardians' duty.

## Qualifications
To take the Oath of the Guardian, a dwarf must have demonstrated a deep respect for tradition and a strong sense of duty. They must be willing to place the safety of their heritage above their own. The path to becoming a Guardian is marked by trials that test one's courage, wisdom, and dedication. Only those who have shown their mettle in these trials are permitted to take the oath.

## Ceremonial Attire and Decorations
The guardians are clad in ceremonial armor that is less ornate than battle gear but equally robust. Each piece is inscribed with runes of warding and preservation. The Warden's armor, in particular, is adorned with motifs that reflect the history and achievements of the guardians who have come before.

The Hall of Echoes is decorated with the banners of the guardians, each bearing the crest of a different lineage or significant event in dwarven history. The floor is inlaid with a mosaic of the 'Eternal Shield', and the walls are lined with alcoves that hold the relics and tomes that the guardians are sworn to protect.

As the ceremony concludes, the new guardians place their hands upon the ancient Anvil of Vows, a sacred relic said to have been used by Dagnath herself, and recite their oath, sealing their pledge to safeguard the continuity of dwarven culture and history.
