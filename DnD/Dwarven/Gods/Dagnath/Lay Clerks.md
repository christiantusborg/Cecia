## The Lay Clerks

The Lay Clerks of Dagnath are the keepers of the dwarven narrative, the silent sentinels who walk the long halls of history and memory. Cloaked in robes the color of aged parchment and the deep brown of the Iron Hills' fertile earth, they are a common sight in the vast libraries and scriptoriums that lie deep within the dwarven realms.

Their fingers are stained with the inks of a thousand tomes, and their eyes gleam with the reflected light of knowledge. Around their necks hang chains of office, from which dangle intricate amulets inscribed with the 'Mindforge' rune, glowing faintly with the power to enhance memory and intellect. These amulets are not only symbols of their station but also tools that allow them to recall every word of the vast lore they protect.

The Lay Clerks are trained from a young age in the art of rune lore, with each individual mastering the delicate process of inscribing Body and Utility Runes. The runes they carry are subtle, often hidden beneath their garments, pressed against their skin in a silent vow of their life's dedication. 'Lorekeeper's Light' runes are woven into their cuffs, and 'Wordweaver' runes are etched along their palms, enabling them to work tirelessly, their hands never faltering in the delicate task of transcription.

In the quietude of their sacred spaces, the Lay Clerks chant the histories of their people, a soft, rhythmic hum that is said to be the heartbeat of Dagnath herself. They are the embodiment of the goddess's wisdom aspect, her voice in the silence of the archives.

The Lay Clerks are chosen for their role through a rigorous process that assesses not only their capacity for learning and memory but also their spiritual connection to Dagnath. They are the chosen few who have shown an innate understanding of the intertwining of death and knowledge, recognizing that in remembering the past, they keep their ancestors alive within the present.

Their lives are one of solitude and study, but within their quiet existence burns the fierce light of devotion. They are the guardians of the dwarven legacy, ensuring that not a single rune of their storied past is lost to the shadows of time.
