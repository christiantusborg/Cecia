## The Legend of the Dharnak Gravewalker Rune

In the shadowed past, within the deep caverns of the Dwarvish stronghold of Necrohold, tales of the undead returning to haunt the living were rampant. These malevolent spirits and reanimated corpses posed a threat to the very soul of the Dwarven community.

Such dire circumstances drew the attention of a revered Dwarvish runesmith named **Kilrin Soulguard**. Understanding the gravity of the undead menace, Kilrin embarked on a mission to harness a rune that could counteract these dark beings.

Years of research, filled with haunting encounters and countless nights delving into forbidden lore, bore fruit when Kilrin forged a rune that, upon striking the undead, would disrupt their very essence. He named this masterpiece the *Dharnak Gravewalker*. Blades inscribed with this rune became bane to all undead, tearing apart their connection to the mortal realm.

The Dharnak Gravewalker quickly achieved a status of legend. Dwarven warriors armed with blades bearing this rune were revered as saviors, the very sight of the rune causing the undead to tremble in fear. The radiant glow of the rune became a symbol of protection and hope in the darkest of times.

With the power to vanquish the undead came the duty to safeguard its secrets. The Soulguard lineage, recognizing the potential misuse of the Dharnak Gravewalker, vowed to protect its mysteries. The Rune of Dharnak Gravewalker remains a glowing testament to Kilrin Soulguard's commitment and the Dwarvish spirit's eternal stand against the shadows of death.
