## The Legend of the Glacidhrun Rune:

Nestled in the Snowdrift Mountains is the Dwarvish enclave of Frostholm. Known for their mastery over ice, the Frostholm Dwarves craft legendary icy weapons.

One winter, Thrain Icesmith, a Dwarvish blacksmith, found a heart-shaped gem of pure ice â€“ the Icecore Crystal. Merging it with metal, he crafted a blade that froze anything it touched. Seeking to control its power, Thrain created the Glacidhrun rune.

With this rune, the blade only freezes when drawn, making it a coveted weapon among warriors.

The legend of Thrain Icesmith's creation is a testament to the Frostholm Dwarves' innovation and the beauty of the icy mountains they call home.
