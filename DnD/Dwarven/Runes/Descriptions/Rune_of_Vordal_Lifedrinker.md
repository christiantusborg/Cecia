# Rune of Vordal Lifedrinker

**Combining**: "Vordal" (a Dwarvish-inspired term that conveys "absorption" or "siphoning") with "Lifedrinker" (indicating a weapon's power to drain life force).

## Effect

The sword drains the life force of foes, healing the wielder with each hit.

## Visual

The rune itself is a haunting amalgamation of Dwarvish sigils. It depicts a central vortex, symbolizing the siphoning of life. Spiraling outwards from this vortex are delicate tendrils, reaching and intertwining, evoking the image of life forces being drawn in. The outer edge of the rune is encased in a jagged boundary, representing the raw power and danger of this life-draining ability. When inscribed on a blade, the rune seems to pulse with a shadowy glow, as if hungering for the vitality it's designed to steal.


## The Legend of the Vordal Lifedrinker Rune

In the dimly lit depths of the Dwarvish stronghold of Grimvault, where life and death danced a precarious tango, tales whispered of blades with a thirst unquenchable. Weapons not just of steel, but of hunger - a hunger for the very essence of life.

Amid this aura of awe and mystery stood **Balin Bloodforge**, a Dwarvish runesmith with a peculiar fascination for the balance of life. Intrigued by tales of vampiric creatures and life-siphoning sorceries, Balin endeavored to channel such power into the very core of a blade.

Through a mix of forbidden rituals, esoteric rune-crafting, and sheer determination, Balin successfully forged a rune that could imbue a blade with the eerie ability to drain life. He named this haunting creation the *Vordal Lifedrinker*. Swords engraved with this rune seemed alive, their strikes draining the vitality of foes and transferring it to their wielders.

The legend of the Vordal Lifedrinker spread like wildfire. Dwarven warriors wielding these insatiable blades became both revered and feared, their wounds healing as they felled their adversaries. The haunting glow of the Lifedrinker rune became a beacon of dread on the battlefield.

But with such predatory power came the weight of responsibility. The Bloodforge clan, realizing the dangers of wielding and misusing the Lifedrinker, guarded its secrets with an intensity that matched the rune's thirst. Today, the Rune of Vordal Lifedrinker stands as a chilling testament to Balin Bloodforge's brilliance and the thin line between life and death in the heart of the mountains.
