# **Missing: Black Cat With White Paws, Answers to "Shadow"**
**Please Help!**

My dear cat, Shadow, has gone missing, and I am very worried. Shadow is a sleek black cat with distinctive white paws and bright green eyes. He's not just a pet but part of my family.

Shadow was last seen near my house in the East Quarter two days ago. He's usually quite adventurous but always comes home. This time, he hasn't returned, and I fear something might have happened to him.

If you find Shadow or have any information about his whereabouts, please bring him back or let me know immediately. I miss him terribly and am offering a reward for his safe return. Thank you so much for keeping an eye out. Shadow means the world to me.

Desperately,

Mila the Baker
