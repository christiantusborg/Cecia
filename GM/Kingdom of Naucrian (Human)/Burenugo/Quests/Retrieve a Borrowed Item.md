# **Retrieve a "Borrowed" Item**

Greetings,

I need someone with a certain... let's call it a 'discreet set of skills.' I lent a valuable item to a wealthy merchant in town, but it seems he's forgotten it's mine. I need it back, but I can't go myself for... various reasons.

The item is a small, intricately carved ivory statuette. It's currently in a locked cabinet in the merchant's study. His house is well-guarded, but it shouldn't be too much of a problem for a person with the right talents.

Success will be handsomely rewarded. Discretion is absolutely necessary. You don't know me if caught, and I can't tell you. Meet me at dusk behind the tavern called The Drunken Dragon to discuss further details.

Remember, discretion is critical.
