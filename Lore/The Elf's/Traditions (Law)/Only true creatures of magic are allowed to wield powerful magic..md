**** Only true creatures of magic are allowed to wield powerful magic


The tradition "Only true creatures of magic are allowed to wield powerful magic" in a society where elves, pixies, dragons, and titans are considered true creatures of magic is deeply significant. This tradition likely stems from a blend of cultural, magical, and practical reasons.

Creation of the Tradition:
Safeguarding Magical Balance: In a world where magic is a potent and potentially dangerous force, this tradition could have been established to safeguard against its misuse. By limiting the use of powerful magic to 'true creatures of magic', it ensures that those wielding such power have a natural affinity and understanding of its complexities and consequences.

Preservation of Natural Order: This rule might also exist to preserve the natural order of the world. True creatures of magic, being inherently part of the magical ecosystem, would use their powers in harmony with the natural world, whereas others might disrupt this balance.

Cultural Heritage and Identity: For elves and similar beings, magic is not just a tool but a core aspect of their identity and heritage. This tradition upholds and honors this deep-rooted connection.

Importance of the Tradition:
Maintaining Harmony and Stability: By ensuring that only those inherently connected to magic can wield its greater powers, the tradition helps maintain harmony and stability in the magical world, preventing chaos that could arise from uncontrolled or irresponsible use.

Protecting Lesser Magical Beings: It also serves to protect beings without strong magical essence from the dangers that come with handling powers they may not fully comprehend or control.

Upholding Hierarchy and Order: The tradition reinforces a hierarchy where higher-ranking elves have the authority to grant lesser beings the use of powerful magic. This hierarchy ensures order and responsibility in the use of such powers.

Exceptions to the Tradition:
Granting Permission by High-Ranking Elves: A high-ranking elf can permit others to wield powerful magic. This exception acknowledges that, under guidance and supervision, non-true creatures of magic can responsibly use such power.

Permanent Grants and Revocation by Aranthir: The fact that only an Aranthir can revoke a permanent grant of magical use underscores their role as guardians of magical law and order. It ensures that such decisions are not taken lightly and are subject to the highest level of wisdom and scrutiny.

Emergency Situations: In dire circumstances, exceptions might be made to allow a non-true creature of magic to wield powerful magic, possibly under strict supervision, to combat a greater threat.

Ritualistic or Ceremonial Use: There might be scenarios where, in a controlled ritualistic or ceremonial context, non-true creatures of magic are temporarily allowed to wield greater magical powers, perhaps as part of a significant cultural or spiritual event.

In summary, this tradition serves to maintain the balance and integrity of the magical world, ensuring that powerful magic is used responsibly and in harmony with the natural order. While exceptions exist, they are governed by strict guidelines and the wisdom of the highest-ranking elves, reflecting the gravity with which such powers are regarded.
