# An elven is above any law, made by mortal kind

The tradition "An elven is above any law, made by mortal kind" reflects a unique perspective on the relationship between elves and other beings, particularly those considered 'mortal kind', including all true creatures of magic. This tradition has specific reasons for its existence, plays a crucial role in elven society, and operates under certain exceptions.

## Creation of the Tradition:
- **Elven Longevity and Wisdom:** Due to their extended lifespans, elves accumulate centuries of wisdom and experience. This tradition might have been created to acknowledge that the laws made by shorter-lived beings may not always align with the deep, long-term understanding that elves possess.

- **Connection to Natural Law:** Elves often see themselves as guardians or stewards of nature, adhering to laws they perceive as natural or universal rather than those constructed by societies. This tradition could stem from a belief in a higher, more ancient set of principles guiding their actions.

- **Preservation of Autonomy:** To maintain their autonomy and ensure their way of life isn't compromised by external influences, this tradition might have been established. It serves as a declaration of sovereignty, asserting that elven society governs itself according to its own values and customs.

## Importance of the Tradition:
- **Cultural Integrity:** This tradition helps preserve the cultural integrity of the elven people. By not adhering to the laws of other races, elves maintain their distinct societal norms and values.

- **Prevention of External Manipulation:** It protects the elven community from being manipulated or controlled by the laws of other societies, which might conflict with their ethos or interests.

- **Reflection of Elven Values:** The tradition is a manifestation of the core values and beliefs of elven society. It emphasizes their deep-rooted connection to ancient wisdom and the natural world, distinguishing their legal and moral compass from that of other races.

## Exceptions to the Tradition:
- **Diplomatic Relations:** In the interest of diplomacy and peaceful coexistence, elves might choose to respect certain laws or agreements made by other beings, especially when these laws align with their values or when violating them could lead to conflict.

- **Individual Choice:** Some elves, particularly those who live among or closely interact with other races, might choose to abide by external laws out of personal belief, necessity, or respect for the customs of those they live amongst.

- **Moral and Ethical Considerations:** In situations where the laws of mortal kind align with the elves' deep-seated ethical beliefs, they might choose to follow these laws not out of obligation but because they resonate with their own principles.
