# The Order of Elandria

The Order of Elandria is a prominent religious organization in the world of midlevel high fantasy. It is dedicated to the worship of Elandria, the Goddess of Balance, Wisdom, and the Cycles of Life. Samhain, one of the most important holidays in this religion, represents a time of reflection, remembrance, and connection with the spiritual realm.

## Samhain in the Order of Elandria

Samhain in the Order of Elandria is celebrated on the last day of the harvest season when the veil between the material world and the spirit world is thinnest. It is a time to honor and remember the ancestors, seek their guidance, and ensure their protection. The rituals and customs include:

1. **Candlelit Vigil:** Devotees light candles and lanterns to guide the spirits of their ancestors back to the mortal realm. They believe that during Samhain, the spirits can visit their living descendants.

2. **Feast of Remembrance:** Families gather for a special feast, setting a place at the table for their departed loved ones. They share stories, memories, and favorite foods of those who have passed.

3. **Masks and Disguises:** To confuse malevolent spirits and honor the masks they wore in life, people often wear masks or disguises during Samhain festivities. It is believed that this practice wards off evil and ensures a peaceful visitation from the spirits.

4. **Divination and Offerings:** Clerics and priests of Elandria perform divination rituals to receive guidance from the spiritual realm. Offerings of food, drink, and other symbolic items are left out for the departed.

5. **Bonfires:** Large bonfires are lit to represent the light of Elandria, guiding the way for both the living and the deceased. Participants may leap over the bonfires as a symbol of cleansing and renewal.

## The Book of Elandria

The Book of Elandria, analogous to the Book of G'Quan, is a sacred text of the Order. It contains the teachings, prophecies, and wisdom of Elandria. It is divided into chapters that explore various aspects of life, balance, and spirituality. Midlevel adventurers seeking guidance from Elandria may consult this tome for wisdom and insight. Key tenets include:

1. **The Balance of All Things:** Elandria teaches that balance is the cornerstone of existence. Everything in life is interconnected, and understanding this balance is essential to achieving harmony and wisdom.

2. **The Cycles of Life:** Elandria's followers believe in the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth. They see death not as an end but as a transition to another phase in the grand cycle.

3. **Wisdom through Reflection:** Followers are encouraged to reflect on their actions and choices, seeking to understand the consequences and learn from them. This introspection leads to personal growth and spiritual enlightenment.

4. **Compassion and Empathy:** Elandria's teachings emphasize empathy for all living beings. Compassion is seen as a means to restore balance and harmony in the world.

5. **Service and Community:** Devotees are encouraged to serve their communities and help those in need. It is believed that by contributing to the well-being of others, one strengthens the bonds of unity and balance in the world.

The Order of Elandria offers a rich and meaningful spiritual path for characters in your D&D 3.5 campaign, with opportunities for quests, character development, and moral dilemmas centered around the themes of balance, wisdom, and the cycles of life.
