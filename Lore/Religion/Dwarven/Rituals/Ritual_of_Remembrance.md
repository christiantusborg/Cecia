# Ritual of Remembrance

## Description

This solemn ceremony is conducted in the Hall of Echoes, a sacred space where the air is thick with the weight of history. The hall is lined with stone plinths, each bearing the carved runes of Dagnath's teachings. During the ritual, the community gathers in a reverent silence as the Stone Voice selects a rune stone for each of the fallen. The names of the deceased are carved into these stones by the eldest rune-smiths, their hands steady with purpose and respect. As each name is etched into stone, the Stone Voice reads it aloud, allowing the echo to carry through the hall. This is followed by a recounting of the individual's deeds, spoken with a cadence that turns history into an almost tangible presence. The ritual concludes with the placement of the rune stones onto their designated plinths, symbolically enshrining the ancestors in the memory of the living.

## Chant

"In stone, our blood; in echoes, our voice. From the deep, we rise; to the stone, we return. Hear us, ancestors, in your halls of silence, we inscribe your deeds. Forever remembered, forever engraved."

## Role: Stone Voice

The Stone Voice is the central figure in the Ritual of Remembrance, tasked with the sacred duty of invoking the ancestors and leading the community in the chant. This individual is not only a spiritual leader but also a historian, one who carries the burden and the honor of keeping the past alive through story and song.

## Insignia

The Stone Voice wears a distinctive pendant or brooch, often made of the same stone used in the hall. It is shaped like an open book, signifying the lore they preserve, with a gemstone at the center representing the heart — the core of their duty to keep the memory of the ancestors alive.

## Qualifications

To become a Stone Voice, one must have a deep understanding of the dwarven history and lore, a voice that commands attention and resonates with the gravity of the past, and a character that embodies the wisdom and impartiality needed to recount the tales of the fallen without favor or prejudice. Mastery of ancient languages is also essential, as the chants often involve complex and archaic dialects that few others can speak.

Upon the threshold of the Hall of Echoes, there I stood, a wanderer from lands afar, beholding the solemnity of the dwarves' Ritual of Remembrance. The air within was as a tome unopened for ages, heavy with the scent of bygone epochs, and the very stones seemed to pulse with the heartbeats of ancient kings.

The sons and daughters of the deep earth were arrayed before me, their attire a tapestry of their heritage. Dark fabrics, rich as the loam of the undermountain, draped over their sturdy forms, each woven with the care of a master craftsperson. The Stone Voice, a figure of reverence, was adorned in a mantle that shimmered with the light of the deep stars, a cloak spun from the night sky itself, set with threads of silver that traced the lineage of kings and warriors of yore.

A chant began, a melody as old as the roots of the mountains, echoing through the cavernous hall. It was a song of remembrance, each note a tribute to the valorous deeds of those who had passed into the stone. The language was not of my kin, but its cadence spoke to me, a universal hymn of honor and memory, as if the very earth sang of its children's undying legacy.

The dwarves bore upon their breasts the sigils of their houses, each a badge of honor, intricately crafted with the precision that spoke of a people who remembered every hammer stroke of their forebears. The sashes that crossed their hearts were not mere decoration but the woven record of their ancestry, each line a verse in the great saga of their people.

As the Stone Voice lifted their voice, the hall was filled with the power of their song, a resonant call that seemed to summon the spirits of the past to join in the rite. The names of the departed were intoned with a reverence that stirred the soul, each one a cherished note in the grand chorus of dwarven history.

The insignia of the Stone Voice, an open tome set with a gem that held the very light of the forge's heart, was a beacon of the saga they all bore. It was a symbol of the unbroken narrative, the continuum of their folk, and the steadfast stone from which they were carved.

In that hallowed hall, I witnessed the unyielding bond that neither the march of ages nor the eroding tide could sever—their homage to the past, the esteem of their kin, and the steadfast strength of their convictions. The dwarves were not merely chroniclers of history; they were the living pillars of its hall, the keepers of its eternal flame.

As the ritual reached its culmination, and the rune stones found their rest upon the sacred plinths, a profound reverence filled my being. It was as if I, too, had been enfolded into the enduring chronicle they so fervently celebrated. I withdrew from the Hall of Echoes with a spirit enriched and a profound respect for the dwarven lore, a lore into which, by their grace, my own thread had been interwoven, if only for the span of a fleeting moment.
