# The Night of Whispers

## Description

The Night of Whispers is a clandestine observance held under the cloak of darkness, where the dwarves commune with the spirits of their ancestors. This ceremony takes place in the most secluded recesses of the Iron Hills, often in ancient chambers known only to the most venerable among them. Here, the air is still, and the silence is profound, broken only by the soft murmur of ancestral voices carried on the subterranean breezes.

## Chant

The chant for The Night of Whispers is a haunting melody, a whispering echo that seems to emanate from the very stones:

"From the depths of the stone, to the breadth of the night,
Hear the whispers of old, in the absence of light.
Spirits of the forge, in the shadows we seek,
Guide our hands, our hearts, our might to bequeath."

## Role: The Whisperer

The Whisperer is the central figure of this sacred night, a dwarf chosen for their ability to bridge the realms of the living and the departed. It is the Whisperer who leads the chant and guides the ceremony, invoking the spirits of the ancestors and seeking their wisdom and guidance.

## Insignia

The Whisperer is marked with a special insignia, a brooch or pendant that bears the image of the 'Echoing Anvil'—a symbol that represents the reverberations of the ancestors' words through time. This insignia is typically made of a rare metal that is said to be found only in the deepest veins of the Iron Hills, reflecting the rarity and importance of their role.

## Qualifications

To be chosen as a Whisperer, a dwarf must exhibit an innate sensitivity to the spiritual world, often evidenced by a life filled with portentous dreams and visions. They must also be well-versed in the ancient lore and possess a deep respect for the traditions of their people. The selection is made through a secretive process, where the current Whisperer identifies a successor based on signs and omens understood only by those who have previously held the title.

## Ceremonial Attire and Decorations

On The Night of Whispers, the Whisperer dons a hooded cloak of deep blue, the color of the twilight sky, embroidered with silver threads that mimic the constellations under which the ancestors were born. The cloak is designed to blend with the darkness, symbolizing the thinning of the veil between the physical and the spiritual.

The chamber of the ceremony is sparingly decorated, with a circle of runes inscribed upon the floor around a central anvil—the sacred space where the Whisperer will stand and commune with the spirits. Dimly lit by the flickering light of runic lanterns, the atmosphere is one of reverence and mystery, a fitting ambiance for a night dedicated to whispers and wisdom from beyond the veil.
