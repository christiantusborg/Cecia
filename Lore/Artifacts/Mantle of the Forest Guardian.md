# Mantle of the Forest Guardian (Artifact minor)

## Description:
The Mantle of the Forest Guardian is a magical cloak infused with the living essence of the natural world. It evolves with the druid, serving as a dynamic reservoir for nature's magic.

## Abilities:

### Spell Infusion (Level 1-9)
- **Description**: The druid selects one nature-related spell at each spell level to infuse into the Mantle. This selection is permanent for each spell level.

### Spell Swap through the Mantle
- **Description**: The first time an infused spell is used each day, it functions as a spell-like ability without consuming a spell slot. 
Additional uses per day allow the druid to cast an infused spell from the Mantle by temporarily swapping it with a prepared spell of the same level. This does not consume an additional spell slot, but it uses the slot of the prepared spell. The number of additional uses is equal to the druid's level divided by 4, rounded down.

### Nature's Embrace
- **Description**: Spells cast through the Mantle often carry additional, minor natural effects, reinforcing the druid's bond with the natural world.

### Growing Synergy
- **Description**: As the druid gains levels (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.), the Mantle provides further abilities that enhance their interaction with nature, such as improved elemental resistance or the ability to navigate natural terrains effortlessly.

## Restrictions:
- The Mantle is attunable only by druids.
- The infused spell for each level must be aligned with natural themes and the druid's connection to the wild.
- When reattuned to a new druid, the Mantle can be re-infused with new spells. However, if it is reattuned to a previous druid, it retains the memory of their infused spells.


## Roleplay-Based Limitations for the Mantle of the Forest Guardian

### 1. Summon Spells (e.g., Summon Nature’s Ally)
- **Roleplay Justification**: Summoning spells form a profound spiritual bond between the druid and nature. The Mantle, as a conduit, cannot forge these deep connections which require the druid's full spiritual focus.

### 2. Cure Spells (e.g., Cure Light Wounds, Cure Moderate Wounds, etc.)
- **Roleplay Justification**: Healing is a personal act, channeling the druid's life energy and empathy. The Mantle, lacking this personal life essence, cannot replicate the unique touch of the druid in healing spells.

### 3. Owl’s Wisdom & Mass Owl’s Wisdom
- **Roleplay Justification**: These spells enhance inner wisdom, a journey intrinsic to the caster. The Mantle, an external artifact, cannot augment such personal, innate clarity and enlightenment.

### 4. Resist Energy & Protection from Energy
- **Roleplay Justification**: These spells require fine-tuning of internal energies. The Mantle, attuned to external natural forces, lacks the capability to manipulate internal energies to the degree necessary for these spells.

### 5. True Seeing
- **Roleplay Justification**: True Seeing demands deep spiritual and mental clarity from the caster's senses. The Mantle, unable to provide this profound level of insight, is not suited for such a spell that roots deeply in the caster's psyche.

### 6. Finger of Death
- **Roleplay Justification**: This spell channels destructive energy, contrasting with the life-affirming essence of the Mantle. The nature-oriented Mantle is incompatible with spells focused solely on destruction and death.

By incorporating these roleplay-based limitations, the Mantle of the Forest Guardian aligns with the druid's spiritual journey and connection with nature, enriching the gameplay experience and emphasizing the druid's personal growth and intrinsic magic.
