Cecia – Dawn of war

Council Glade
As I venture deeper into the Elven Forest, a realm shrouded in an aura of ancient mystique, my path leads me to the fabled Council Glade. This hallowed clearing, ensconced in the forest's heart, unfolds before me like a scene from a forgotten dream, resplendent in its serene majesty.
The trees surrounding the glade are venerable sentinels of time, their gnarled trunks standing as silent witnesses to centuries. These ancient guardians, their bark etched with the wisdom of ages, lean inward over the clearing, as if convening in quiet council or to share secrets known only to them. Their branches, adorned with leaves that shimmer in a spectrum of greens, form an intricate lattice overhead, dappling the ground with patterns of light and shadow. The air, heavy with the scent of moss and earth, carries an ethereal quality, as if imbued with the very essence of magic that the elves are so intimately connected with.

The Council Glade itself is a marvel of natural beauty and elven craftsmanship. The ground, carpeted with a lush tapestry of moss and delicate forest flora, feels soft underfoot, inviting one to tread lightly, as if walking on sacred ground. At the glade's heart lies the focal point of this enchanting assembly: In the heart of this sprawling, circular clearing, lies the council's centerpiece: a table of such exquisite craftsmanship it could only be the work of elven hands. Fashioned from the finest silverwood, a timber as rare as it is beautiful, the table glows with a soft internal light. The sun, breaking through the leafy canopy, speckles its surface with patches of luminescence, making it appear as if the table itself were alive, its surface rippling like the waters of a serene forest pond at dawn.
This table is encircled by twelve chairs, each a testament to the skill and artistry of their creators. Carved from the same luminous silverwood, these chairs are adorned with intricate symbols and designs, each distinct, each telling the story of one of the elven castes. From delicate floral patterns that seem to bloom from the wood to intricate geometric designs that speak of a deeper, more ancient wisdom, these chairs are not merely seats but symbols of the diverse and rich tapestry of elven culture.
Yet, amidst this circle of unity, one chair commands particular attention. Standing at the head of the table, the thirteenth chair is a marvel of elven craftsmanship. It radiates a soft, ethereal glow, as if it were the physical manifestation of the collective spirit of the elven people. This chair, unassigned and majestic, symbolizes not the authority of a single leader, but the combined wisdom and strength of the entire elven community. It is a reminder that in this space, all are equal, and every voice is valued.

Beyond this central ensemble, the glade extends into natural terraces, rising gently in concentric circles. These terraces provide seating for the elven spectators, each level offering a clear view of the council table below. Elves from different castes have already begun to gather, their lithe forms moving gracefully to find their places. Some settle on the lower terraces, close to the heart of the discussions, while others climb higher, seeking solitude or a broader perspective. The arrangement of these terraces, so seamlessly integrated into the landscape, exemplifies the elves' deep reverence for nature, their structures coexisting in perfect harmony with the surrounding environment.
The atmosphere in the glade is one of tranquil anticipation. Hushed conversations in melodious elvish tongues meld with the whispering leaves and the soft rustle of animals in the underbrush. Here and there, bursts of gentle laughter ripple through the air, adding to the tapestry of sound. Golden fireflies, like living embers, weave between the elves, casting a soft, ethereal glow that enhances the glade's enchantment.
As I stand in awe, taking in the beauty and solemnity of the Council Glade, I feel a profound sense of reverence and wonder. This place is not just a meeting point for the elves; it is a sacred space where the harmonious balance of nature, the depth of ancient wisdom, and the vibrant tapestry of elven culture converge. It is a testament to the elves' reverence for tradition, their respect for the natural world, and their commitment to the principles of unity and democracy. In this magical clearing, beneath the watchful gaze of ancient trees and the caress of dappled sunlight, the pulse of elven life beats strong, a rhythm as timeless as the forest itself.

As I stand among the gathered crowd, my eyes taking in the grand spectacle before me, there's an air of palpable excitement and reverence that fills the space. The event unfolding is no ordinary affair; it's an election, but one so steeped in tradition and ceremony that it feels more like a grand festival of sorts, a celebration of culture and achievement that I find both fascinating and utterly captivating.
The setting is breathtaking, a harmonious blend of natural beauty and architectural elegance, characteristic of elven design. The ancient trees, their branches swaying gently in the breeze, seem to be silent observers, witnessing yet another chapter in the long history of this society. The open area is thronged with elves of all ages and from all walks of life, each one radiating a sense of pride and expectation.
At the center of it all is the stage, where the candidates, one representing each distinct group within this society, are presented. The uniqueness of each candidate is immediately apparent, not just in their attire, which is a rich tapestry of colors and styles, but in their demeanor - some exude calm confidence, others a quiet strength.
What truly sets this election apart, however, is the presence of the heralds. As each candidate is introduced, a herald steps forward. These individuals are more than mere speakers; they are the narrators of each candidate's story, and their words weave a spell over the audience.
With eloquence and flair, the heralds recount the achievements of the candidates. They speak of heroic deeds, of artistic masterpieces, of scholarly advancements, and of selfless acts that have enriched their community. Each story is a thread in the larger tapestry of this society's values and aspirations.
The attention to detail in these narrations is astounding. It's not just a listing of accomplishments but a vivid portrayal of each candidate's journey, their challenges, their triumphs, and their contributions to the greater good. The audience listens, rapt, as these tales unfold, a mixture of awe and respect evident in their eyes.

Even though there's usually just one candidate from each group, the process feels intensely competitive, not in a contentious way, but as a celebration of excellence. The air is thick with a sense of shared history and communal pride.
The atmosphere is electric, charged with the collective energy of the gathered elves. It's a communal experience, a shared journey into the stories and achievements of those who seek to lead. The election transcends the mundane mechanics of voting; it becomes a testament to the community's values and its collective spirit.
As the ceremony progresses, I find myself swept up in the majesty and the meaning of it all. It's a reminder that leadership is not just about power or position; it's about service, excellence, and the respect of one’s peers. This election is a powerful display of a culture that values not just the end result but the journey and the qualities one embodies on the way.
Standing here, as a spectator in this captivating event, I feel a sense of privilege. It’s a window into a society that cherishes its traditions, honors its heroes, and takes great care in choosing those who will lead them. It's an experience that stays with you, a vivid memory of how deeply beauty, tradition, and respect can be woven into the fabric of governance.
As I did see the election unfolds before my eyes, a vivid tapestry of tradition and excellence, my thoughts drift to a story that embodies the very essence of what we, as a society, hold dear. It's a story that resonates with the values reflected in this grand ceremony, a tale of overcoming adversity through wisdom and unity one of the stories did stand out to me.
Tail of the elders
Gather 'round, good folk, for I bring you a tale, a tale of strife turned to serenity, of a land torn by war's cruel hand, and of a hero, our Aerendyl Fëanor, whose wisdom brought forth peace from the jaws of despair. As a humble elf , I've sung of battles fierce and loves lost, but none so poignant as the story of the Duskwood Accord.
In days yore, when the world teetered on the brink of ruin, and the Duskwood echoed with the clash of the Principality of Qeq and the enigmatic Kingdom of Zhazru, there arose a conflict so fierce it threatened to consume all in its fiery maw.

 The Qeq, bold and unyielding, marched forth, their eyes set on conquest, not knowing the power they awoke in the sacred groves of Zhazru. And the Zhazru, guardians of ancient ways, responded with a fury born of ages past, their magic a storm that swept the land.


But amidst this fury and flame, a beacon of hope emerged. Our Aerendyl Fëanor, a figure of unparalleled wisdom and grace. He, who saw beyond the veil of enmity and understood the hearts of both sides, stood firm in the chaos.

In the fading light of a war-torn day, Aerendyl Fëanor, embarked upon a journey destined to alter the course of history. His silhouette, a lone beacon of hope, traversed the blood-soaked fields – lands that had witnessed the unforgiving wrath of war between the Principality of Qeq and the Kingdom of Zhazru.
Aerendyl's steps were measured, each footfall a somber echo amidst the desolation. His robes, once vibrant with the hues of the forest and sky, now bore the stains of conflict – a tapestry of sorrow for the fallen. The setting sun cast long shadows, painting his path in a haunting interplay of light and darkness, as if nature itself bore witness to the gravity of his quest.
Around him, the remnants of battle lay scattered – the shattered shields, the dulled blades, and the unspoken stories of valor and sacrifice. The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the smoldering embers of destruction, carried the muted cries of the wounded and the whispers of the departed.
Yet, amidst this carnage, Aerendyl Fëanor walked with a resolve that transcended the chaos. His eyes, deep pools of wisdom and sorrow, reflected a vision of a future where peace could bloom once again on this hallowed ground.
His journey led him to an ancient, enchanted glade in the heart of Duskwood – a place untouched by the ravages of war, where time seemed to stand still. The glade was a hidden sanctuary, where the twilight danced perpetually through the leaves of ageless trees, casting the land in an ethereal, amber glow.
At the center of the glade, a crystal-clear pond mirrored the twilight sky, its waters a canvas for the ballet of light and shadow. The ancient oaks, their bark etched with the wisdom of centuries, stood as silent sentinels, their branches weaving a protective canopy over the clearing.
Mystical runes, remnants of a forgotten age, glimmered faintly upon the stones that ringed the pond. These runes hummed with an ancient magic, a testament to the sacredness of this ground – a neutral haven where enemies could meet as equals.
As Aerendyl Fëanor entered the glade, the air seemed to shift, the weight of impending destiny palpable in the cool breeze. Here, in this conclave of nature and magic, he awaited the arrival of the emissaries – the representatives of Qeq and Zhazru.
The glade, bathed in the serene light of countless stars, became a stage for what was to be a historic reconciliation. The tranquil beauty of the place stood in stark contrast to the turmoil of the outside world, a reminder of what could be regained through peace.
In this moment, Aerendyl Fëanor was not just an elf, a diplomat, or a sage. He was a harbinger of hope, a weaver of futures, standing at the nexus of a wounded past and a healing tomorrow. The Duskwood Accord, born in this hallowed glade, would echo through time – a testament to the power of understanding, the resilience of the spirit, and the enduring quest for peace.
He reached into the depths of the Qeq's ambitions, their newfound magic not a tool of war, but a key to unlock diplomacy's door. And to the Zhazru, he brought empathy, a promise that their sacred lands would be honored, their traditions upheld.
In the enchanted glade, under twilight's eternal gaze, he brought forth the leaders, their hearts heavy with loss. There, with eloquence born of true understanding, he crafted an accord, a pact that sang of a future bright.

The Duskwood Accord, a testament to his genius, brought an end to the strife. The Qeq and Zhazru, once foes, now stood together, their enmity washed away by the wisdom of his words.
So, as we stand on the cusp of a choice, a decision that will shape our future, remember the hero who turned war to peace, who saw hope in despair. Cast your voices in favor of Aerendyl Fëanor, the architect of harmony, the beacon of our times.
For in him lies not just the wisdom of ages but the promise of a brighter tomorrow. Let his story echo through the halls of time, a melody of peace and unity, sung for generations to come.
Raise your voices, good folk, for in our Aerendyl Fëanor, we have not just a leader, but a visionary, a peacemaker, a true hero of our age!

As the Keeper of Ceremonies stood before the gathered assembly, the significance of the moment was palpable. His voice, resonant with the wisdom of ages, carried across the hall, reaching every ear, every heart.

"My beloved kin of Ar’Tel'Quessir," he began, his gaze sweeping across the sea of faces, "today we stand at a juncture of great importance, a moment that is woven into the very fabric of our history and destiny. The claiming of Ar’Tel'Quessir, the Chair of Change, is an event that, while rare, always heralds a pivotal shift in our society's path."

He paused, ensuring his words had taken root in the minds of his audience. "This chair," he continued, "is not just a seat at the High Table. It is the embodiment of our collective courage to embrace change, to question, and to grow. It represents our acknowledgment that the flow of time brings new tides and new challenges, and that we, as a people, must be ready to navigate these waters."

"Ar’Tel'Quessir, the Chair of Change, is our testament to the belief that our traditions, as sacred as they are, must not bind us so tightly that we cannot move forward. It is a reminder that the wisdom of our ancestors, while guiding us, also empowers us to seek new horizons."

"Throughout our history, the taking of this chair has always marked a significant turn in our society's journey. It has brought about reforms, innovations, and advancements that have shaped our identity and destiny. Each elf who has claimed this chair has left an indelible mark on our history, steering us through times of uncertainty and into eras of prosperity and enlightenment."

"The act of claiming Ar’Tel'Quessir, the Chair of Change, is, in itself, a courageous deed. It requires the vision to see beyond the present, the wisdom to understand the deeper currents of our society, and the fortitude to stand in the face of doubt and challenge. It is a path not for the faint of heart, but for those who are driven by a profound love for our people and a deep desire to see them thrive in an ever-changing world."

"Today, as we witness another of our kin step forward to claim this chair, we are not just observing a ceremonial act. We are participating in a moment of history, a turning point that will be remembered and recounted in the annals of Ar’Tel'Quessir. Let us embrace this moment with open hearts and minds, ready to ponder and deliberate the changes proposed, for in doing so, we honor not just the brave soul who steps forward but the very essence of what it means to be Ar’Tel'Quessir."

With these words, the Keeper of Ceremonies reaffirmed the deep-seated reverence for Ar’Tel'Quessir, the Chair of Change, and its crucial role in shaping the course of elven history. The assembly, moved by his words, looked on with a renewed understanding of the gravity and promise of this moment, ready to witness history in the making.
It was the Keeper of Ceremonies who broke the silence, his voice resonating with a gravitas that echoed through the marble columns. “This day,” he declared, “shall be etched in the annals of history, for it has been 114 years since Ar’Tel'Quessir, the Chair of Change, was last claimed.” He turned, his ceremonial robes whispering against the stone floor, to face the enigmatic elf. “Tell us, what change do you seek to bring forth?”
The elf rose, a movement fluid as a shadow in the moonlight. In a singular, mesmerizing motion, he drew two gleaming swords, their blades singing a deadly melody as they cut through the air. With swift, precise strikes, he turned upon the two council members seated beside him. The blades moved with such speed and grace, they seemed extensions of his own will, leaving a haunting silence in their wake where once had been the steady breaths of his now-fallen peers.
This shocking act, executed with a chilling elegance, sent ripples of disbelief and horror through the assembly. The elf stood there, swords in hand, a figure of defiance and power, his intentions as enigmatic as the night sky. The hall, once a place of revered tradition, had in a single moment transformed into a tableau of grim possibilities, a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of change and the weight of history about to be rewritten.

Into this profound stillness, the figure cloaked in black moved. His stride was not just a mere walk; it was a dance of shadows and purpose, each step a deliberate testament to his unyielding resolve. The cloak, dark as a moonless night, billowed behind him, trailing like the whispers of forgotten secrets. There was an elegance to his movement, a poise that spoke of a deadly grace, akin to a panther stalking through the depths of an ancient forest.

His approach towards Ar’Tel'Quessir, the Chair of Change, was a visual symphony of determination and purpose. The eyes of the assembled elves followed him, wide with a mixture of awe and apprehension, as he traversed the distance between destiny and tradition. The gentle clinking of his armor beneath the cloak was the only sound that dared to pierce the silence, a subtle reminder of the martial strength that this enigmatic elf embodied.

As he moved, the flickering torchlight cast ever-changing shadows across his face, momentarily revealing glimpses of steely resolve etched into his features. His eyes, sharp and penetrating, held a depth of conviction, a burning intensity that suggested not just a readiness to embrace the change he was about to claim, but to forge it with his own hands.



As the initial shock of the elf's swift and ruthless act reverberated through the hall, a sudden, chaotic movement rippled through the crowd of spectators. From within their midst, several figures, cloaked in the same ominous black as the elf at the Chair of Change, rose with a sudden, lethal intent. It was as if shadows had come to life, each one mirroring the deadly purpose of the first.

These cloaked figures moved among the assembled elves with a terrifying efficiency, their actions synchronized in a dance of death. Each movement was precise, each strike fatal, as they cut down those around them with a cold, emotionless efficiency. The glint of steel flashed from beneath their cloaks, a haunting echo of the elf's earlier violence.

Panic erupted in the once solemn assembly. The air, so recently heavy with silence, was now filled with the discordant sounds of chaos – shouts of alarm, the clashing of steel, the thud of bodies falling. Elves, renowned for their grace and composure, now scrambled in a desperate bid for safety, their elegant robes catching on the marble floors as they sought to escape the unexpected massacre.

The confusion was overwhelming, a maelstrom of fear and disbelief. Elders and dignitaries, once pillars of wisdom and calm, were now caught in the throes of uncertainty, their faces etched with horror. The hall, designed to be a place of unity and ceremonial grace, had transformed into a battlefield, its beauty marred by the brutality unfolding within its walls.
Amidst this chaos, the cloaked figures moved unimpeded, their purpose singular and clear. They seemed to be everywhere at once, striking down those who stood in their way with a chilling detachment. The contrast between the elegance of the surroundings and the violence of their actions created a surreal tableau, a nightmare unfolding in a place that had been a symbol of peace and tradition.
The panic was not just physical; it was a shattering of trust and understanding. The very foundations of their society, built on harmony and mutual respect, were being torn asunder by these enigmatic assailants. The air was thick not just with fear, but with the heavy, suffocating realization that their world would never be the same again. This was not just an attack; it was a declaration that the old ways, the old certainties, were being irrevocably shattered.
The guards of the Glade, elite protectors of the assembly, sprang into action with a swiftness born of rigorous training and an unwavering duty to safeguard their kin. Adorned in armor that gleamed like the first light of dawn, they drew their swords, the metal singing as it left the scabbards, a sound that once symbolized justice and order, now a clarion call to battle against an unforeseen menace.

As they charged towards the cloaked figures, their movements were a blend of practiced martial skill and the innate agility of their elven heritage. Each guard moved with a grace that belied the urgency of their mission, their feet barely making a sound on the marble floor, even as their armor clinked softly with each movement.

The clash between the guards and the assailants was immediate and ferocious. Swords met in a shower of sparks, the sound of metal on metal reverberating through the hall. The guards fought with a disciplined ferocity, their faces set in grim determination as they sought to overcome the intruders and put an end to the carnage.

The black-cloaked figures, however, were not ordinary foes. They moved with an eerie coordination, as if guided by a single, malevolent will. Their strikes were not only precise but seemed to anticipate the guards' movements, countering with a speed and ferocity that was almost inhuman. The cloaks they wore fluttered with each twist and turn, making them seem like wraiths, spectral and deadly.

Amidst this chaos, the central figure at the Chair of Change stood like the eye of a storm, calmly observing the battle that he had instigated. His presence seemed to embolden the other cloaked figures, lending them a sinister focus.

The guards, for all their skill, found themselves not only fighting the cloaked figures but also battling to protect the unarmed elves who were still scrambling for safety. It was a fight on two fronts – one to subdue the attackers and the other to shield their kin from harm.

The battle was a tumultuous symphony of clashing steel, desperate shouts, and the harsh breaths of combatants. It was a dance of death and duty, played out on the grand stage of the hall, each guard desperately trying to turn the tide of an engagement that had descended into madness. The elegance of their movements was now edged with desperation, each parry and thrust a bid to stem the tide of violence unleashed by the mysterious assailants.

This was not just a physical confrontation; it was a battle for the soul of their society. Each blow struck by the guards was a testament to their resolve to protect the values and traditions that the assailants sought to destroy. The outcome of this battle would determine not just the survival of those present, but the future of their way of life, which now hung precariously in the balance.

As the brutal skirmish reached its crescendo, a moment of decisive action unfolded near the Chair of Change. The guards of the Glade, though battered and weary, coordinated a final, desperate assault against the central black-cloaked figure. With a collective surge of energy, they broke through the defensive circle of his counterparts, their swords gleaming with the determination to end the chaos.

In that pivotal moment, the figure at the chair, the instigator of the turmoil, made a swift, decisive move. With a grace that belied the violence of his actions, he turned and placed a hand upon the Chair of Change.
With a commanding gesture, he conjured a vortex that seemed to be spun from the very essence of magic, No sooner had this happened than the air itself seemed to crackle with energy  a swirling tempest of dark hues and shimmering, intangible forces. It twisted and writhed around him like a living entity, The air within this maelstrom shimmered and distorted, bending light and sound.

As the elf stood at its center, his figure became blurred and indistinct, obscured by the swirling cloak of magic that enveloped him. The guards, their blades poised for justice, could only watch in stunned disbelief as he began to fade, his form dissolving into the vortex like ink dispersing in water.


Then from every direction, red signal spells burst forth, soaring into the air like a swarm of fiery comets. The sky above was soon ablaze with these signals, painting a vivid tapestry of urgent, scarlet light against the dark canopy of the night.

I remember standing there, amidst the chaos, my heart pounding in my chest. Could this really be happening? The realization hit me like a physical blow – we were under attack from every direction. The red signals, typically used as a call for aid or a warning of imminent danger, now seemed to scream of a betrayal most profound. The sight of them, soaring from within and beyond the walls of our once-peaceful assembly, was a stark and harrowing declaration that our enemies were not just at our gates, but within them.

The world around me felt surreal, as if time had slowed down. The sounds of battle, the cries of the wounded, and the clash of steel seemed distant, muffled by the shock of what was unfolding. It was a moment of stark, chilling clarity – our realm was not just facing a rogue assailant or a group of rebels. This was a coordinated assault, a well-planned and executed strike at the heart of our society.

The guards, now realizing the extent of the treachery, fought with renewed fervor, driven by a desperate need to protect their home from this unforeseen and overwhelming threat. But the question that haunted every mind was clear – how had it come to this? Who were these assailants that had so cunningly infiltrated our ranks and turned a ceremony of change into a night of bloodshed and betrayal?
