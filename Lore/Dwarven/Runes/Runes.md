## Rune Magic

### Rune Magic Game Rules

#### Runes on Masterwork Items
- **Masterwork Requirement:** Runes can only be added to masterwork quality weapons and armor.
- **Enhancement Bonus:** Each rune added to a masterwork item grants a +1 enhancement bonus. This bonus reflects the increased quality and magical potency of the item due to the rune.

#### Soul Weapons and the Seventh Rune

## Soul Swords

**Description:** A soul sword is a weapon of unparalleled power and rarity, created through a profound and sacred process. When a Dwarf stands on the brink of death, they may choose to freely give their very soul to the blade, imbuing it with their essence and consciousness. This voluntary act of soul transfer grants the weapon intelligence, aligning it with the soul donor's alignment and endowing it with their knowledge and wisdom. A soul cannot be forced into a sword; it must be willingly given.

**Characteristics:**
- **Intelligent Weapon:** A soul sword becomes sentient, capable of communicating telepathically with its wielder.
- **Alignment:** The sword adopts the alignment of the soul donor, influencing its behavior and guidance.
- **Guidance:** The sword provides counsel based on the donor's experiences and moral compass, aiding the wielder in decisions and actions.
- **Bond and Influence:** The sword's influence is strongest when the wielder's goals align with the donor's life mission. The more divergent the wielder's path, the more the sword will attempt to steer them towards its own alignment and objectives.

**Additional Note:** Soul swords are even more rare than commonly known. While Dwarves are the most prevalent creators of these weapons, it is possible for the souls of other beings—such as pixies, elves, dragons, and titans—to be infused into weapons as well. This knowledge is a closely guarded secret, with no Dwarf willing to disclose it unless to a close and trusted friend, or in repayment of a great debt.

### Dark Secret: The Forced Soul Rune

Known only to the darkest and most unscrupulous individuals, there exists a forbidden method to create a soul sword by forcibly binding a soul into the blade. This method uses a different, corrupted rune from the ones typically used in creating a soul sword. The process of forcing a soul into the sword not only corrupts the soul but also strips it of all virtuous traits, leaving only the darkest desires and intents. As a result, the sword's alignment is always twisted to evil.

**Characteristics of a Forced Soul Sword:**
- **Corrupted Intelligence:** The sword is sentient, but its consciousness is warped and malevolent.
- **Evil Alignment:** The soul's alignment is irreversibly corrupted, making the sword inherently evil.
- **Malevolent Guidance:** The sword urges its wielder towards dark and destructive actions, often manipulating them to fulfill its own twisted desires.
- **Unpredictable Influence:** The sword's influence can be dangerous and unpredictable, as it seeks to dominate the wielder's will and enforce its malevolent agenda.

**Additional Note:** Almost all Dwarves will try to destroy these dark rune swords on sight. They are considered a dark chapter of Dwarven history, and the creation of such a rune is strictly forbidden. The penalty for creating or wielding a forced soul sword is death. Dwarves believe that these cursed blades must be destroyed at any cost to prevent their malevolent influence from spreading.

### The Legend of the Soul Sword

In the ancient halls of Karak Varn, where the echoes of ancestral Dwarven heroes still whispered through the stone, the practice of creating soul swords was born. This sacred ritual was reserved for the greatest of Dwarven warriors, those whose deeds and honor merited eternal remembrance.

The legend speaks of Thrain Ironheart, a venerable warrior who defended his kin against an onslaught of orcs during the Siege of Karak Varn. As Thrain lay dying on the battlefield, his resolve remained unbroken. Summoning his final strength, he called upon the ancestral rites and freely gave his soul to his beloved blade, Varngrath.

With a flash of light and a surge of power, Varngrath became more than steel and enchantment—it became Thrain's living legacy. The blade pulsed with the fierce determination and wisdom of its creator, ready to guide future generations in their darkest hours.

Thrain's soul sword was said to have turned the tide of many battles, its wielder always benefiting from the unyielding spirit of Thrain Ironheart. The creation of such weapons became a revered tradition, each soul sword a beacon of hope and an indomitable force against the encroaching darkness.

To this day, the soul swords are both feared and revered, their wielders chosen not just for their strength, but for their alignment with the enduring values and missions of the Dwarven heroes who gave their souls to forge them.

However, in the shadowy depths of forgotten lore, whispered only among the most corrupt and power-hungry, lies the knowledge of the forced soul rune. This dark secret remains a testament to the depths of depravity to which some will sink in their quest for power. The Dwarves, ever vigilant, stand ready to eradicate these abominations and uphold the sanctity of their noble tradition.
