# **Cecia Rune Creation Guide (v2.1)**  
*For D&D 3.5e Rune Magic – Structured Rune Design Prompt*  

This guide helps you design new runes step-by-step, ensuring game balance, flavor, and creativity.

---

## **PHASE 1: DEFINE THE RUNE TYPE (Input Phase)**

### **Step 1: What kind of rune are you creating?**  
Choose **one or more** (or add your own):
- ⚔ **Weapon Rune** – Placed on masterwork weapons  
- 🛡 **Armor Rune** – Placed on masterwork armor/shields  
- 🔮 **Staff Rune** – Used for spellcasting foci  
- 🧠 **Soul Rune** – Only the 7th rune; must be a Soul Weapon  
- ☠️ **Corrupted Soul Rune** – Forbidden, evil-aligned  
- 🧍‍♂️ **Body Rune** – Placed on the wearer’s skin (self-affecting)  
- 🌀 **Utility Rune** – Inscribed on objects or ambient surfaces  
- ✏️ **Other**: `______`

---

## **PHASE 2: DEFINE THE EFFECT (Input Phase)**

### **Step 2: What is the rune’s magical concept?**  
Choose a theme or write your own:
- 🔥 Fire / Heat  
- ❄ Ice / Cold  
- ⚡ Lightning / Thunder  
- 🌿 Nature / Beasts / Earth  
- 🕯 Shadow / Fear / Stealth  
- 💨 Wind / Movement / Speed  
- 🧠 Mind / Psychic / Illusions  
- 🧬 Healing / Soul / Resurrection  
- ✨ Arcane / Spell Storage / Magic  
- ⏳ Time / Haste / Delay / Rewind  
- ➡️ **Your input**: `______`

---

### **Step 3: Rune Slot Mechanics**  
Decide how the rune behaves regarding *rune slots* (1–7 on a weapon/armor):

- 📈 **Scaling** – Rune’s strength grows with higher slot level (1 to 7)  
- 🔒 **Fixed Slot** – Works only if placed in a specific slot (e.g., 3rd)  
- 🧬 **Minimum Threshold** – Activates only if placed in slot X or higher  
- 🧠 **Soul Rune Only** – Must occupy the 7th slot of a Soul Weapon  
- ❌ **No Slot** – Typical for Body or Utility runes (standalone)

> **Tip Box – Quick Slot Mechanics Reminder:**  
> - **Runic Items** (Weapons/Armor) have up to 7 slots.  
> - **Soul Runes** occupy the final (7th) slot, forging a deeper bond.  
> - **Body Runes** or **Utility Runes** don’t occupy item slots; they have unique activation rules.  

➡️ **Your choice**: `______`

---

### **Step 4: Rune Category (Optional)**  
Pick one (or more) to guide balancing and flavor:
- ⚔ **Combat Effect** – Damage, debuffs, mobility  
- 🛡 **Enhancement Effect** – Buffs, defenses, protections  
- 🎭 **Utility Effect** – Light, telepathy, detection, movement  
- ☠️ **Curse Effect** – Poison, mind control, restrictions  

➡️ **Your category**: `______`

---

## **PHASE 3: EVALUATE POWER (Calculation Phase)**

### **Step 5: Estimate Rune Power**  
Compare it to known D&D 3.5e spells/items:

- 🎯 **Minor** – Comparable to *Mage Hand*, *Light*, 1d2–1d4 damage  
- 🪓 **Lesser** – Comparable to *Magic Weapon*, 1d4–1d6 elemental  
- ⚖️ **Moderate** – Comparable to *Flame Blade*, *Mirror Image*  
- ⚔ **Strong** – Comparable to *Haste*, *Invisibility*, 1d10+ or AoE  
- 🔮 **Legendary** – Comparable to *Resurrection*, *Time Stop*  

➡️ **Your input**: `______`

> **Why This Matters:**  
> - Higher power = higher crafting DC  
> - More dangerous/rare runes require advanced knowledge (like 5th+ level spells)  

---

## **PHASE 4: DESIGN & STYLE (Input Phase)**

### **Step 6: Choose a Rune Name**  
You will receive **3 Dwarvish-style name options** by default.  
They often look like compound words (e.g., “Draugr-Keðja,” “Myrkrstinga”).  

➡️ **Prefer one**, or suggest your own: `______`

---

### **Step 7: Visual Design and Lore Hooks (Optional)**  
1. **Appearance**: How does the rune look when inscribed?  
   - 🔥 Glowing lava lines  
   - ❄ Frost-crystal patterns  
   - ⚡ Jagged electric bolts  
   - 🌿 Vines, bark, or leaf-like glyphs  
   - 🕯 Shifting shadows or dark ink  
   - 🧬 Floating arcane circles  
   - 🧍 Tattoos, glowing skin (for Body Runes)  
   - 🌀 Elemental or abstract shapes (for Utility Runes)  
   - ➡️ **Your style**: `______`

2. **Lore Hooks** (Optional):  
   - **Brief Myth** – A short legend about its origins  
   - **Quest Hook** – Adventure seed tied to discovering or creating this rune  
   - **Creator’s Tale** – Who originally forged it?  
   - ❌ Skip Lore – Just mechanics, please  

➡️ **Your lore preference**: `______`

---

## **PHASE 5: GENERATION (Output Phase)**

**When you have completed all steps above, request the final generation.**  
**The system will provide:**  
1. **Three Dwarvish Name Options**  
2. **Full Mechanics** – Slot behavior, power scaling (if chosen), and activation rules  
3. **Rune Appearance** – Based on your chosen style  
4. **Difficulty Estimates** – Crafting DC, learning requirements  
5. **Lore or Quest Hooks** – If requested  

> **All with balanced 3.5e guidelines** to keep your game fun and fair!

---

### **How to Use This Prompt**  
1. **Fill in each step** with your choices or custom text.  
2. **Ask** the system to generate the final rune details.  
3. **Refine** any details you’d like changed: rename abilities, tweak power, add or remove effects, etc.

### **Bonus Tips**  
- If you’re unsure about power level, start **small** and see how it plays. You can always adjust later!  
- Consider using official D&D 3.5e spells as **benchmarks** for how strong each rune effect should be.  
- Make sure to **roleplay** the forging, discovery, or activation of these runes to enrich your story.

Feel free to copy/paste the entire structure above and tweak it for your table! This version adds clearer headers, a quick slot mechanics tip box, optional lore hooks, and bullet-point clarity—while still providing the 3 Dwarvish name options and covering all rune types. Happy rune-crafting!
