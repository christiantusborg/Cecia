## The Legend of the Thurgar-Thum Rune

High in the stormy peaks of the Thundercrag Mountains, the Dwarven stormcaller, Thargrim Stormsinger, sought to capture the essence of the tempest. Amidst the howling winds and crashing thunder, Thargrim inscribed the Thurgar-Thum Rune onto his blade, harnessing the raw power of the storm. With each swing, the sword would echo the might of the thunder, stunning foes with its fearsome roar.
