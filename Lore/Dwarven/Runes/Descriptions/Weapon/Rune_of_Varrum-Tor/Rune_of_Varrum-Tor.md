## The Legend of the Varrum-Tor Rune

Deep within the shadowy depths of the ancient Dwarven stronghold of Khazad-Nol, a forbidden ritual was performed in secrecy. Only the most desperate and corrupt of the Dwarven kin dared to attempt it, known as the Ritual of Varrum-Tor. The legend speaks of a time of great despair, when the Dwarves faced annihilation from an overwhelming enemy. A rogue clan, led by the dark-hearted Thrain Bloodsorrow, sought power at any cost to save their peopleâ€”or so they claimed.

In a hidden chamber, Thrain and his followers captured the souls of their enemies, binding them into weapons using a dark and twisted rune. The result was the creation of the Varrum-Tor rune, a mark of unspeakable torment and power. Each sword crafted with this rune became sentient, filled with the malevolence of the trapped soul, always seeking to corrupt and destroy.

The Dwarves soon realized the true cost of this forbidden magic. The wielders of these dark blades became monstrous, their hearts twisted by the malevolent whispers of the soul within. The Dwarven council declared the rune heretical, its use punishable by death, and sought to destroy every weapon tainted by the Varrum-Tor.

Yet, whispers persist of these cursed blades, hidden away in dark places, waiting to be found by the unwary or the power-hungry. The Dwarves remain ever vigilant, ready to eradicate these abominations should they resurface.

### Description of Creator
Thrain Bloodsorrow was once a respected Dwarven warrior, known for his fierce determination and cunning in battle. However, the endless wars and the looming threat of annihilation drove him to seek darker powers. Consumed by the desire to save his kin at any cost, Thrain delved into forbidden lore and uncovered the secrets of soul-binding.

Driven by desperation and a twisted sense of duty, Thrain performed the Ritual of Varrum-Tor, creating the first of the cursed soul swords. His actions, though initially successful in turning the tide of battle, brought doom upon his clan. Thrain himself fell victim to the whispers of his own creation, his soul forever bound to the very weapon he had forged.

The legacy of Thrain Bloodsorrow serves as a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition and the dark path of forbidden magic. His name is spoken with a mixture of fear and revulsion among the Dwarves, a cautionary tale of power gained at too great a cost.
