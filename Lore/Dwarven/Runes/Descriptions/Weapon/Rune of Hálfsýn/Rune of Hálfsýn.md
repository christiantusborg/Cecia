## 5. Visual  
The rune appears as an **open eye surrounded by layered arcs**, etched in silver-blue lines. When active, it pulses like a heartbeat. On strike, it releases a flare of ghostlight that clings to hidden beings as a **shimmering, translucent outline**, impossible to conceal.

## 6. The Legend of the Rune of Hálfsýn  
Forged during the **Invasion of the Hollow Veil**, when entire Dwarven regiments vanished to unseen foes, this rune was born of desperation and ingenuity. **Baldun Rimeforged**, a veteran runesmith, created it after losing his brother to an unseen fey assassin. With the rune, Baldun turned his sword into a torch against the dark — and drove back the invisible.

His success brought hope, but also fear. The rune made enemies visible — and thus, vulnerable — a fact not lost on the shadowy courts of the Feywild, who now whisper of a curse upon its wielder.

---

## 7. Description of Creator  
**Baldun Rimeforged** was a reclusive Dwarven smith known for forging anti-magic sigils. Cold, methodical, and haunted by loss, he poured all his focus into ensuring no more dwarves would fall to the unseen. His forge was said to burn with pale blue flame, and his tools were etched with runes older than kings. He vanished after completing the *Lexicon of Unseen Truths*, a tome of runes that may still lie hidden in the Underdelve.

## 8. Visual Representations (Optional)

### 1. First Weapon with the Rune  
A single-edged Dwarven greatblade named **Hálmskugg** (“Shadow Breaker”), its fuller glowing faintly blue when near invisible beings.

### 2. Inspiration for the Rune  
Baldun watched pixies vanish into moonlight, their giggling echoes leaving behind only blood. That moment never left him.

### 3. The Creator in Action  
Swinging his hammer with slow, precise rhythm over a ghostlit anvil, Baldun’s silhouette never flinched — even as shadowstalkers circled just beyond the torchlight.
