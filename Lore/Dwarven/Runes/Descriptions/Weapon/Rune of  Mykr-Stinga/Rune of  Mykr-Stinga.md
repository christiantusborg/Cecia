## **1. Rune/Item Name**  
**Rune of Mykr-Stinga**  
(*Dwarven name meaning “Shadowstrike,” translated as SG’HADOW*)

---

## **2. Combining (Name Etymology)**  
- **Mykr** — Dwarven root for "shadow" or "darkness"  
- **Stinga** — Dwarven for "strike" or "piercing attack"  
The name *Mykr-Stinga* combines the two to mean **“strike from the shadows.”**  
Translated in the rune tongue as **SG’HADOW**, a stylized magical contraction of "Shadow" with emphasis on phasing stealth.

### **4.2 Rune Rarity**  
**Rare**

### **4.3 Effect Variation Based on Location**

- **Location 1:**  
  Once per round, when the wielder attacks a flat-footed target, the weapon ignores half of the target’s armor bonus to AC (rounded down). This applies only to mundane, non-magical armor.

- **Location 2:**  
  Once per round, when the wielder attacks a target who is flat-footed or flanked, the weapon ignores the full armor bonus to AC. This does not affect natural armor, enhancement bonuses, or shields.

- **Location 3:**  
  Once per round, when the wielder attacks a flat-footed target, the weapon ignores both the target’s armor bonus and natural armor bonus to AC. Shield bonuses and magical enhancement bonuses are not ignored.

- **Location 4:**  
  Twice per round, the weapon ignores the target’s armor bonus to AC, even if the target is not flat-footed or flanked. Natural armor bonus is ignored only if the target is flat-footed.

- **Location 5:**  
  Once per round, the weapon ignores both armor bonus and natural armor bonus to AC, regardless of the target’s condition. This does not affect shield bonuses or magical enhancements.

- **Location 6:**  
  Once per round, the weapon ignores armor bonus, natural armor bonus, shield bonus, and magical enhancement bonuses to AC. This effect applies on any attack regardless of condition.

- **Location 7:** *(Soul Swords Only)*  
  On every attack, the weapon ignores armor bonus, natural armor bonus, shield bonus, and magical enhancement bonuses to AC. Additionally, the weapon deals +2d6 damage against flat-footed or unaware targets.

### **4.4 Additional or Specific Rules**

- The rune affects only physical defenses (armor, natural armor, shield, and enhancement bonuses). It does not bypass deflection bonuses, dodge bonuses, or magical effects like *mage armor* or *shield spell*.
- The rune does not grant the ability to see invisible or hidden targets; stealth and positioning remain important.

#### **4.4.1 Roleplay Rules (Optional)**  
This rune is feared by warriors and guards alike. Dwarves often require an oath of honorable use before inscribing it. In some regions, weapons bearing this rune must be registered or are outlawed entirely.

#### **4.4.2 Critical Hit Effects (Optional)**  
On a critical hit, the sword bypasses all physical defense and forces the target to make a **Fortitude save (DC = 10 + ½ wielder’s level + Dexterity modifier)** or become **staggered for 1 round**.

---

## **5. Visual**  
The rune appears as an angular curve bisected by a jagged line, resembling a shadow tearing open a surface. On the sword, it pulses with a dull purple shimmer, and during activation, the blade becomes momentarily translucent. When phasing through armor, the sword emits no sound at the point of impact.

## **6. The Legend of the Rune of Mykr-Stinga**  
In the forgotten depths of **Khar’drulh Vault**, a blind Dwarf named **Tholgar Nightforge** crafted this rune after the massacre of his kin by armored invaders. He sought a way to render even the strongest steel worthless. Hidden for decades, the rune was rediscovered during the Goblin Purge, where assassins bearing this rune ended warlords in a single strike.

The rune became a symbol of both liberation and fear—hailed by the oppressed, reviled by traditionalist warriors who saw it as dishonorable.

---

## **7. Description of Creator**  
**Tholgar Nightforge**  
- A once-renowned rune-smith turned reclusive after losing his sight in battle.  
- Crafted the Rune of Mykr-Stinga using heat, touch, and a special technique involving smoke inscriptions.  
- Believed that runes should reflect intent, not tradition. He never forged the same rune twice.  
- Vanished into the Underdelve—rumored to still live, forging runes of vengeance in the dark.

## **8. Visual Representations (Optional)**

### 1. **First Weapon with the Rune**  
**Whisperfang**, a long, blackened dwarven sword with a single violet rune near the base. The blade becomes shadowy when raised in silence.

### 2. **Inspiration for the Rune**  
The slaughter of Dwarves cornered in heavy armor by lighter foes who bypassed their defense—Tholgar sought to even the scale.

### 3. **The Creator in Action**  
A dim forge chamber, with only braziers lit. Tholgar’s calloused fingers trace the rune in soot on steel, flames flickering with each stroke.
