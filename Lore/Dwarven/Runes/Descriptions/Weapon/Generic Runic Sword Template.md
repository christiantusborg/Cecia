# **Cecia Rune Creation Guide (v2.2)**  
*For D&D 3.5e Rune Magic ‚Äì Structured Sword Rune Design Prompt*  

This guide helps you design new **sword runes** step-by-step, ensuring game balance, flavor, and creativity.

---

## **PHASE 1: DEFINE THE RUNE TYPE (Input Phase)**

### **Step 1: Confirm You‚Äôre Making a Sword Rune**  
Since we‚Äôre focusing on runes for **swords**, you can note any special sword properties here (e.g., longsword, greatsword) or unique forging details.  

- ‚öî **Weapon Rune (Sword)** ‚Äì Placed on masterwork (or better) swords

*(All other rune types‚Äîarmor, staff, body, soul, etc.‚Äîare omitted.)*



## **PHASE 2: DEFINE THE EFFECT (Input Phase)**

### **Step 2: What is the rune‚Äôs magical concept?**  
Pick or describe the core **theme** you want for your sword rune. Some examples:

- üî• Fire / Heat  
- ‚ùÑ Ice / Cold  
- ‚ö° Lightning / Thunder  
- üïØ Shadow / Fear / Stealth  
- üí® Wind / Movement / Speed  
- üß† Mind / Psychic / Illusions  
- üß¨ Healing / Soul / Life Drain  
- ‚è≥ Time / Haste / Delay / Rewind  
- **Your own idea**: `______`

---

### **Step 3: Rune Slot Mechanics**  
Swords can have up to **7 rune slots**. Decide how your rune behaves:

- üìà **Scaling** ‚Äì Power grows with higher slot level (1 to 7).  
- üîí **Fixed Slot** ‚Äì Works only in a specific slot (e.g., must be in slot 3).  
- üß¨ **Minimum Threshold** ‚Äì Activates only if placed in slot X or higher.  
- ‚ùå **No Variation** ‚Äì Same effect regardless of slot.

> **Tip ‚Äì Sword Rune Slots (1‚Äì7):**  
> - Each slot can hold one rune.  
> - Runes can offer different effects per slot or require a specific slot to function.

‚û°Ô∏è **Your choice**: `______`

---

### **Step 4: Rune Category (Optional)**  
Pick one (or more) to guide balancing and flavor:

- ‚öî **Combat Effect** ‚Äì Extra damage, debuffs, or crowd-control  
- üõ° **Enhancement Effect** ‚Äì Defense or protection (e.g., parry, AC bonus)  
- ‚ò†Ô∏è **Curse Effect** ‚Äì Harmful or corrupting effect on wielder/target  
- üé≠ **Utility Effect** ‚Äì Movement, illusions, minor special abilities

*(Since we‚Äôre focusing on swords, ‚ÄúCombat Effect‚Äù is most common, but choose what fits your design.)*

‚û°Ô∏è **Your category**: `______`

---

## **PHASE 3: EVALUATE POWER (Calculation Phase)**

### **Step 5: Estimate Rune Power**  
Compare to known D&D 3.5e **spell/item** power levels:

- üéØ **Minor** ‚Äì Up to ~1d4 extra damage or a small cantrip-level buff  
- ü™ì **Lesser** ‚Äì Up to ~1d6‚Äì1d8 damage or effects like *Magic Weapon*  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Moderate** ‚Äì Comparable to ~2nd‚Äì3rd level spells (e.g., *Flaming*, *Shocking* enhancements)  
- ‚öî **Strong** ‚Äì Comparable to ~4th‚Äì5th level spells (e.g., significant damage boosts or special crowd-control)  
- üîÆ **Legendary** ‚Äì ~6th level spells and beyond (resurrection-like powers, major time manipulation, etc.)

‚û°Ô∏è **Your input**: `______`

> **Why This Matters:**  
> - Stronger runes require higher **Crafting DC** and may be rare or restricted in your setting.  
> - Keep it balanced so it‚Äôs fun for everyone!

---

## **PHASE 4: DESIGN & STYLE (Input Phase)**

### **Step 6: Choose a Rune Name**  
By default, you‚Äôll receive **3 Dwarvish-style name options** (e.g., ‚ÄúMyrkrstinga,‚Äù ‚ÄúFasth√°marr‚Äù). You can pick one or propose your own custom name.

   - Or your own unique style: `______`

2. **Lore Hooks** (Optional):

   - **Quest Hook** ‚Äì How adventurers discover or obtain it  
   - **Creator‚Äôs Tale** ‚Äì Who forged this rune and why?  
   - ‚ùå **Skip Lore** ‚Äì Just mechanics, please

- For 3.5e, use official spells (e.g., *Flame Blade*, *Shocking Grasp*) as **benchmarks** to keep damage/effects fair.  
- **Roleplay** the forging, discovery, or usage of these sword runes to enrich your campaign‚Äôs story!
