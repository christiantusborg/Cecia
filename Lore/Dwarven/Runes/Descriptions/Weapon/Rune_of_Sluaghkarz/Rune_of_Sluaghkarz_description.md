### Rune of Sluaghkarz


**Combining**
- "Sluagh" (Dwarvish for 'acid')
- "Karz" (Dwarvish for 'bite' or 'strike')

## Effect
Dealing additional acid damage and corroding armor and weapons.

### Roleplay Rules
The Dwarves forbade the creation of the Sluaghkarz Rune due to its highly destructive nature, capable of irreparably corroding armor and weapons. This corrosion posed a significant risk to the balance and fairness in battle, unlike other runes that enhance combat without causing such permanent damage. The destructive potential of acid was deemed too dangerous and unpredictable, leading to its prohibition.

## The Legend of the Sluaghkarz Rune

In the marshlands of Cecia, a reclusive alchemist named Arandor the Foul discovered a potent acid that could dissolve even the strongest metals. Driven by a thirst for power, Arandor inscribed the Sluaghkarz Rune onto his blade, imbuing it with the acid’s destructive properties. Tales of his exploits spread, as his enemies' armor and weapons would corrode and fail in battle, leaving them defenseless against his onslaught.

## Description of Creator

Arandor the Foul, once a respected alchemist, turned to dark experimentation in his pursuit of ultimate power. Isolated in his marshland laboratory, Arandor delved into forbidden knowledge, eventually creating the Sluaghkarz Rune. His name became synonymous with fear, as his victims were left with little more than rust and ruin after facing his corrosive wrath. Arandor’s legacy is a testament to the dangerous allure of unchecked ambition and the transformative power of runic magic.
