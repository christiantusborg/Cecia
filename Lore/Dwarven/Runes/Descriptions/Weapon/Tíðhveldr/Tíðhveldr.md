## ü™ì **1. Rune/Item Name**  
**T√≠√∞hveldr**  
*(The Rune of Temporal Strike ‚Äì ‚ÄúTime-Turner‚Äù in Old Dwarven)*

---

## üî° **2. Combining (Name Etymology)**  
- **T√≠√∞** = Time / Tempo / Moment  
- **Hveldr** = To turn / rotate / alter

> Together: *T√≠√∞hveldr* = *‚ÄúTime-Turner‚Äù* ‚Äî a rune designed to bend the perception and flow of time in battle.

---

## ‚ú® **3. Short Description or Core Effect**  
This rune distorts time itself for the wielder. It begins with heightened perception and swift movement and scales up to allowing full additional actions within combat rounds, as if time briefly pauses for all but the swordbearer.

### 4.3 **Effect Variation Based on Location (Scaling)**

> üìà Scaling effects from Rune Slot 1 to 7:

- **Location 1:** The wielder gains a +5 bonus to initiative and can move through difficult terrain without penalty for 1 round per encounter.  
- **Location 2:** Once per encounter, the wielder may make an attack of opportunity even when flat-footed or denied Dexterity.  
- **Location 3:** The wielder gains **haste** (as the spell) for 3 rounds once per day (standard action to activate).  
- **Location 4:** As above, but **haste** is now usable **once per encounter** as a **free action**.  
- **Location 5:** Once per encounter, the wielder may take an **extra swift action** during their turn.  
- **Location 6:** Once per encounter, the wielder may take an **additional standard action** on their turn.  
- **Location 7:** Once per day, the wielder may take a **full additional turn immediately after their current turn**, as if time froze for others.  
   > **Limitations**:  
   > - This turn does not allow immediate reactions.  
   > - All cooldowns remain in effect unless specified otherwise.  
   > - Visual effect: Reality flickers like a skipping stone ‚Äî the wielder appears in two places at once.

---

### 4.4 **Additional or Specific Rules**

- **Concentration Check (DC 18 + spell level)** is required to cast spells during the bonus action (at slots 6‚Äì7) due to temporal stress.
- The sword must be wielded by a creature that **perceives linear time**. Aberrations and beings from the Far Realm cannot benefit.

---

#### 4.4.1 **Roleplay Rules**  
- Wielders of T√≠√∞hveldr gain fragments of future memories. They may **once per session** ask the DM one ‚Äúyes or no‚Äù question about an event **within the next hour of in-game time**.  
- Prolonged use of the rune may cause ‚Äútemporal scars‚Äù: deja vu, echoes, or slipping into combat stances out of reflex.

---

#### 4.4.2 **Critical Hit Effects**  
- On a critical hit, time fractures briefly. The wielder may **choose one of the following** (once per round):  
  1. Regain a swift action  
  2. Delay the target‚Äôs next action by 1 initiative step  
  3. Remove one condition affecting the wielder (*fatigued*, *shaken*, etc.)

---

## üßø **5. Visual**

- **Rune Shape**: A concentric hourglass interlaced with interlocking arcs  
- **Glow**: Emits a faint shimmer of **silver and violet** with drifting motes that move **in reverse motion**  
- **Activation**: When the rune activates, everything within 10 feet appears to **blur and ripple**, while the wielder stays sharp and clear  
- **Slot 7 Special**: Brief phantom images of the wielder repeat their movements an instant later, like visual echoes

## üìñ **6. The Legend of T√≠√∞hveldr**

The Rune of Temporal Strike was born not in battle, but in **stillness between battles** ‚Äî in that breathless, watchful second before the first sword leaves its scabbard.

It was created by the enigmatic dwarven arcanosmith **Vaekrun of the Last Flow**, the only known dwarf to have **traveled through a looped time fracture** in the Mirror Caverns of Khol-Zed√ªn. He spent lifetimes ‚Äî or possibly mere days ‚Äî studying how dwarves might harness controlled time loops for use in real combat.

T√≠√∞hveldr was not his first rune. It was his **final** and only *perfected* one ‚Äî made of **platinum-gold alloy**, etched only during solar eclipses, and cooled in flowing glacier streams enchanted to flow in both directions.

The rune was wielded by only one known champion: **Captain Vareth Stonepulse**, commander of the Twilight Vanguard. She used T√≠√∞hveldr to defeat an army of trolls by **acting multiple times while they were still in mid-step**. Her final act was to **suspend herself in time** so the rune could never fall into enemy hands.

## üõ† **7. Description of Creator**

### **Vaekrun of the Last Flow**

- **Race**: Dwarf  
- **Profession**: Arcanosmith, Clock-Seer, Rune-Tect  
- **Age at Disappearance**: 211  
- **Base**: Mirror Caverns of Khol-Zed√ªn (now lost in time)

---

### **Personality**  
Obsessive, focused, and eerily serene. Vaekrun often spoke in half-complete sentences, finishing them hours later as if they had only paused. Many said he was **‚Äútemporally unsynced‚Äù**, but never confused.

He wore five rings, one for each potential outcome of a moment, and often scratched invisible runes in the air while thinking.

---

### **Crafting Philosophy**  
Vaekrun believed runes were **bridges between what is and what could be**. Each must reflect the flow of time, fate, and motion. His workbench was a mixture of fine dwarven steel, obsidian hourglasses, and ancient elven calendrical charts.

He crafted **T√≠√∞hveldr** over a span of four years ‚Äî or possibly four hours, depending on which timeline you ask.

---

### **Legacy & Fate**  
He vanished during a test of his own rune. Witnesses saw him step into a slow-motion strike, and then disappear into a glittering stream of reversed lightning. Some say he‚Äôs still walking that moment.

Others claim that when T√≠√∞hveldr activates fully, **he watches through the blade.**

---

## üñº **8. Visual Representations**

1. **First Weapon with the Rune**:  
   A rapier forged of starlit steel with a hilt that shows the reflection of the moon regardless of time or location. It was named **Hveldsong**.

2. **Inspiration for the Rune**:  
   A single falling drop of water hanging in the air ‚Äî unmoving ‚Äî for what felt like an eternity during a duel. It never hit the ground.

3. **The Creator in Action**:  
   Vaekrun is seen turning an obsidian hourglass upside down, then again, then again ‚Äî as if waiting for time itself to respond to his will.
