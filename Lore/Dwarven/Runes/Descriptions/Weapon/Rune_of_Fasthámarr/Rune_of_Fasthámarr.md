## The Legend of the Fasthámarr Rune

In the shadowy depths of the Forgotten Catacombs, the Dwarven smith **Thrain Shadowstrike** crafted the Rune of Fasthámarr. Thrain, known for his cunning and resourcefulness, sought to create a weapon that could confront foes from beyond the physical realm.

His inspiration came during a harrowing encounter with an incorporeal wraith. Unable to strike the creature with conventional weapons, Thrain dedicated himself to forging a rune that could pierce the veils between the worlds.

After months of research and numerous failed attempts, Thrain succeeded. The Rune of Fasthámarr allowed weapons to bypass physical armor and strike ethereal and incorporeal beings. This rune quickly became revered among warriors facing spectral adversaries.
