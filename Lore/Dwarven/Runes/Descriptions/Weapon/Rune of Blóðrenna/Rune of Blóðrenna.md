## 5. Visual  
The rune is shaped like a vein, jagged and uneven, etched down the fuller of the blade. At rest, it appears as a dull black scar on the metal. Upon striking a foe, it glows crimson and pulses faintly. With each hit, thin wisps of red mist begin to coil from the rune. At full power, the sword trails crimson vapor like a smoke ribbon and appears to ‚Äúbreathe.‚Äù

## 6. The Legend of the Rune of Bl√≥√∞renna  
Created by the exiled Dwarf runesmith **Drekvar the Cruel**, Bl√≥√∞renna was the first of the forbidden war runes. Drekvar crafted the rune from his own blood under a red moon after watching his clan fall to invaders. His weapon, known as *Woundreaper*, was said to bleed enemies dry in mere seconds ‚Äî and to whisper when it hadn‚Äôt tasted blood.

Bl√≥√∞renna was declared cursed by the High Runesmiths of Karak Varn. All weapons bearing it were to be destroyed, and Drekvar‚Äôs name was stricken from all records. Even so, rumors persist of blood cults in the mountains still forging blades in his name.

---

## 7. Description of Creator  
**Name:** Drekvar the Cruel  
**Race:** Dwarf  
**Title:** Exile, Bloodwright  
**Traits:**
- Brilliant, paranoid, obsessed with vengeance  
- Forger of forbidden runes using lifeblood  
- Believed to have disappeared into the earth after giving his own soul to the blade

His final rune-stroke was said to burn his name into the hilt of Woundreaper itself ‚Äî in letters no cleric has since been able to erase.

## 8. Visual Representations (Optional Subsections)

### 1. First Weapon with the Rune  
**Woundreaper** ‚Äì a wide-bladed dwarven longsword forged of volcanic blacksteel. The rune burns faintly red unless bathed in blood, at which point it glows so brightly it lights the area like a torch.

### 2. Inspiration for the Rune  
The battlefield of Thundermoor, where hundreds of dwarves were butchered. Drekvar stood alone in the mud among corpses and wept until he carved the rune directly into his own hand.

### 3. The Creator in Action  
A bloodstained dwarf hunched over an anvil lit by lightning and moonlight, murmuring old rites and driving the rune into the steel with a chisel dipped in his own vein.
