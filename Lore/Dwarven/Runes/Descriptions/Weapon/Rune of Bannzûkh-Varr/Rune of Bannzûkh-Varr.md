## **1. Rune/Item Name**  
**Rune of Bannzûkh-Varr**

## **2. Combining (Name Etymology)**  
- **Bannzûkh** (Dwarven): *Banaz* (to exile/expel) + *Zûkh* (spirit/soul)  
- **Varr**: A term for sword or blade in Old Dwarven  
> **Meaning:** “Spirit-Exiling Blade” or “Sword of Soul-Banishment”

---

## **3. Short Description or Core Effect**  
This rune forces extraplanar creatures struck by the blade to make a special Will save or be banished to their home plane. The rune’s power increases in higher slots, gaining additional effects including return prevention, delay, and soul-infused enhancements.

## **4. Game Rules**

### **4.1 Rune Difficulty**  
**+15** (Hard) – Requires advanced planar understanding and precise inscription.

### **4.2 Rune Rarity**  
**Very Rare** – Known only to a few Dwarven runesmiths and planar guardians.

### **4.3 Effect Variation Based on Location**  
> **Note:** Each higher location includes the effects of all previous locations unless stated otherwise.

- **Location 1:** No effect  
- **Location 2:** On a confirmed critical hit, the target must make a Will save (DC = Spell’s save DC – Creature’s HD + your Caster Level). On failure, the creature is banished to its home plane.  
- **Location 3:** Will save applies even on a regular hit (limited to once per round).  
- **Location 4:** If the creature succeeds the save, it is staggered for 1 round.  
- **Location 5:** On a failed save, the target cannot return via planar travel for 1d4 days unless *wish* or *miracle* is used.  
- **Location 6:** You may choose to delay the banishment by 1 round, allowing dramatic or tactical effect (e.g., timed banishment).  
- **Location 7:** If the weapon is a **soul sword**, the rune gains a +2 bonus to the Will save DC. Additionally, the banished creature is branded with a glowing planar rune that allows planar tracking via *discern location* or *scrying* from its native plane.

Certainly! Here's the **updated section** with the **limitation removed**, and the complete entry remains consistent and balanced without it:

### **4.4 Additional or Specific Rules**

- **Saving Throw Formula:**  
  Will DC = (10 + Rune Forger's Intelligence Modifier + Rune Slot Level Bonus) – Creature’s HD + Caster Level  
- **Spell Resistance:** Rune bypasses SR only on critical hits or when used from slot 7 on a soul sword.

#### **4.4.1 Roleplay Rules (Optional)**  
- This rune is a sacred rite among Dwarves who guard the Material Plane. Use against celestial emissaries or bound spirits is politically sensitive and may lead to diplomatic consequences.  
- Using the rune on native outsiders (e.g., tieflings or aasimar) is seen as a moral violation in many cultures.

#### **4.4.2 Critical Hit Effects (Optional)**  
- On a critical hit from Location 3+, the rune’s banishment bypasses **Spell Resistance** entirely.  
- If the target is **not extraplanar**, it becomes **dazed** for 1 round instead.


## **5. Visual**  
The rune is etched as a spiral that pulls inward, forming a vortex with seven angular glyphs radiating around it. When activated, it glows silver-blue and emits a harmonic tone audible only to outsiders. Upon triggering, the glyph bursts with planar light, and the struck creature is enveloped in spectral chains before vanishing in a shimmer of energy.

## **6. The Legend of the Rune of Bannzûkh-Varr**  
In the final hours of the **Siege of the Splintered Star**, when infernal and elemental armies poured through rifts into the mountain realm of **Zarak-Dûm**, the runesmith **Dworn Eldseal** crafted a weapon not to destroy, but to cast out. Harnessing the dust of a fallen *planar anchor* and molten silver laced with soulsteel, he forged the first **Rune of Bannzûkh-Varr** onto his sword *Thralgarn*.

When the rune first activated, Dworn banished an ancient marilith mid-charge, turning the battle’s tide. Since then, only those deemed "Guardians of the Threshold" may learn this rune. The dwarves view it as a holy seal against otherworldly corruption.

---

## **7. Description of Creator**  
**Dworn Eldseal**, High Runekeeper of the 9th Vault, was famed for his obsession with *dimensional sanctity*. He believed the Material Plane should remain untouched by extraplanar interference. A minimalist and planar scholar, he forged only four known swords before vanishing into a collapsing demi-plane to test his *soul-sealing* theory.

His craftsmanship was mathematical—symmetrical and deliberate—with hidden runic redundancies meant to echo into other dimensions. His apprentices claim his final words were, “The gate swings both ways—but we shall decide who walks through.”

## **8. Visual Representations (Optional)**

### **1. First Weapon with the Rune:**  
*Thralgarn*, a broad-bladed greatsword with seven planar symbols embedded in a spiral on the flat of the blade. Its edge gleams like silvered starlight, and the blade hums faintly when in proximity to extraplanar creatures.

### **2. Inspiration for the Rune:**  
Dworn’s final vision—an ethereal storm at the rift’s edge, where spirits were torn from the mortal world by unseen forces. He saw a vortex formed by Dwarven glyphs holding the line. This image burned into his mind and became the basis of Bannzûkh-Varr.

### **3. The Creator in Action:**  
Dworn at the forge, hammering threads of soulsteel under a blue crystal lens focused through an ancient *planar compass*, each strike synchronized with a harmonic note from a singing stone.
