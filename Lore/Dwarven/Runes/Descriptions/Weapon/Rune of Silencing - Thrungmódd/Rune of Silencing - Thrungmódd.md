  ❌ **Cannot be placed here.**

- **Location 4:**

  - While silenced, the target cannot speak, use verbal spell components, or activate verbal-based magical effects.

## **5. Visual**  
The rune etched into the blade appears as a spiral of broken echo-lines, surrounded by quiet notches that glow faint violet. When activated, the rune sends out a visible ripple of distortion, like warped air, and the sound of battle briefly hushes in its wake.

## **6. The Legend of the Rune of Silencing**  
The rune was forged by **Thraun Wyrmbinder**, a dwarven smith who lost his voice to a dragon’s roar and sought revenge through silence. He carved the rune with no voice, no chant, and no words—inscribing it solely through the will of his grief. Thraun's blade, *Skálfa*, silenced warlords and spellcasters alike during the Siege of Redspire Keep.

---

## **7. Description of Creator**  
**Thraun Wyrmbinder** was once a flamboyant bard-smith known across the mountains. After being cursed by a wyrm that devoured his voice, he turned inward, devoting his life to mastering silence as both shield and sword. His last words, written in runeform, read: “Let silence be the first blow.”

## **8. Visual Representations**

1. **First Weapon with the Rune:**  
   *Skálfa*, a darksteel longsword with mirrored edge and faint violet runic spirals, rests in a temple that never echoes.

2. **Inspiration for the Rune:**  
   A chamber in the Temple of Echoes where even gods cannot speak—Thraun walked out with the rune burned into his thoughts.

3. **The Creator in Action:**  
   Thraun, seated in silence, carving the rune with tears dripping onto a cold forge, never once uttering a sound.
