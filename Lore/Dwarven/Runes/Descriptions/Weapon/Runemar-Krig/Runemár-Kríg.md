## üìñ **6. The Legend of Runem√°r-Kr√≠g**

**Runem√°r-Kr√≠g** was first etched by **Drogan Emberline**, who believed perfection in combat came not from rage or strength‚Äîbut clarity. During his exile, he dueled hundreds to prove this belief and never lost a single match.

The rune was said to glow brightest not when surrounded by blood, but when justice demanded the blade be drawn. Dwarves tell tales of Emberline drawing his sword only once in a duel, his foe already defeated before the steel left the scabbard.

---

Absolutely! Here is the **full, rich description** of the creator of **Runem√°r-Kr√≠g**‚Äîmaster forgemage and warrior-philosopher **Drogan Emberline**.

---

## üõ† **7. Description of Creator**  
### **Name**: Drogan Emberline  
### **Race**: Dwarf  
### **Class**: War-Smith (custom prestige class ‚Äî combination of Fighter, Artificer, and Lorekeeper)  
### **Age at Disappearance**: 143  
### **Home Hall**: D√∫rgrath-Khaz (now abandoned)

---

### **Personality & Beliefs**  
Drogan was known throughout dwarven lands as a silent storm ‚Äî not for his temper, but for his **overwhelming presence** in any room or battlefield. He rarely spoke, but when he did, his words cut with the same precision as his strikes.  

He believed that true martial power had **nothing to do with strength** and everything to do with **clarity, timing, and purpose**. For Drogan, a blade was not a tool for killing ‚Äî it was a mirror that revealed the soul of the one who wielded it. He called combat *‚Äúthe final truth of character.‚Äù*

Unlike many dwarves, he **shunned ornamentation** in his work, preferring clean lines, unadorned grips, and balanced steel that any hand ‚Äî noble or lowborn ‚Äî could wield equally.

---

### **Crafting Style & Rune Philosophy**  
Drogan‚Äôs smithing process bordered on religious ritual. He would spend **weeks in meditation**, performing kata with unarmed hands before even striking the forge. Only when he achieved what he called *‚Äúmental alignment with the strike‚Äù* would he begin carving runes.

His runes were famed for their **surgical precision** in both etching and effect. He rejected the more flamboyant battle-runes of his age that burst into flame or screamed with lightning. Instead, his works **refined the wielder**, removing doubt and hesitation, until nothing remained but the perfect moment to strike.

The **Runem√°r-Kr√≠g** was his final gift to the world ‚Äî a distillation of his entire philosophy into a single mark.

---

### **Legacy & Reputation**  
Though Drogan was **exiled** from D√∫rgrath-Khaz for slaying a noble in a ‚Äúdishonorable‚Äù duel, many believe the noble had secretly used a cursed weapon. Drogan‚Äôs refusal to explain himself only worsened his fate ‚Äî but also gave birth to his legend.  

After his exile, he wandered the high passes and **challenged over seventy swordmasters** ‚Äî humans, elves, even hobgoblin bladelords. **He never struck first**, and **never lost a duel**.  

His disciples became known as **Kr√°lsmarks**, or the Battle-Marked ‚Äî a wandering order of duelists who carry his legacy in silence.

Some believe Drogan still lives, awaiting a challenger worthy enough to forge a second rune.

---

### **Final Fate (Legends and Rumors)**  
- **Last Seen**: Entering the ruined dueling arena of **Gr√°fjeld**, followed by six renowned swordsmen who had come to kill him together. None returned. The arena was later found empty, save for a rune-etched circle on the stone.  
- **Legacy Weapon**: *Vrakur-D√ªm*, his personal blade, has not been seen in over sixty years. Some say it waits embedded in an obsidian pillar in the Howling Peaks, accepting only those it deems ‚Äúready.‚Äù  
- **Cult Rumors**: A secret sect within dwarven society believes that Drogan carved a **final rune onto himself**, turning his soul into a living rune that guides worthy bladesmen in battle.
