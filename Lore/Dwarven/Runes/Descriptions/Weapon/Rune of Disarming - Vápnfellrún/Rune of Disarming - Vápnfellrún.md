### 4.3 **Effect Variation Based on Location**

> ❌ **No scaling in mechanics**, but **slot determines combat feature unlocked:**

- **Locations 1–5:**  
   Every successful melee attack allows the wielder to attempt a **Disarm attempt** as a free action (no AoO).  
   Uses standard Disarm rules; wielder may substitute weapon bonus for Strength if higher.  
   Does not require Improved Disarm feat.

- **Locations 6–7:**  
   The effect becomes equivalent to **Improved Disarm**:  
   - No attack of opportunity

- **Activation**: On contact, a pulse of force flickers along the blade toward the opponent’s weapon  
- **Slot 6–7 Enhancement**: The pulse becomes visible as a **metallic arc** that strikes the enemy’s weapon hand directly

## 📖 **6. The Legend of Vápnfellrún**

In the age of clan feuds, when blood spilled endlessly for insult or politics, one dwarf named **Dalkarn Bristlenose** sought to create a rune not for killing — but for **ending battles cleanly**.

He traveled across three holdfasts, offering non-lethal dueling services as a *Grip-Breaker*. Wherever he walked, weapons clattered to stone, and grudges ended with silence instead of screams.

The Rune of Disarming was inscribed on the swords of bodyguards, peacekeepers, and even temple wardens sworn to nonviolence.
