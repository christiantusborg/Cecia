### üìú BACKSTORY

Durgrim Ironbraid was born into **nobility** in a dwarven mountain city (TBD), heir to a house renowned for both diplomacy and smithcraft. Raised among courts and forges, he trained to become a **Rune Smith and a statesman**.

But the murder of his only son‚Äîa death tied to **court politics and silence**‚Äîshattered his legacy.

Since that day, Durgrim has **refused to forge**, vowing before **Duun** that he will not lift a smith‚Äôs hammer again until justice is done.

He now roams the world with only his **personal sword**, seeking truth, battle, and a cause worthy of his fire.
