# Wizard of the Mystic Voyagers

**Race:** Any (Require Approval)

## Core Concept
Wizard of the Mystic Voyagers are both arcanists and explorers, chronicling their magical discoveries and journeys in two separate but equally important tomes: a Spell Book and a Journey Book. Mystic Voyagers cannot specialize in a school and does not have a familiar, as their spellbook is better than normal.

## Master Journey Tome & Individual Journey Books

### Concept Overview
The Master Journey Tome is a central, magical repository that holds the collective knowledge and experiences of all Mystic Voyagers. Each Mystic Voyager possesses an individual Journey Book, which is magically linked to the Master Journey Tome.

### Functionality

#### Memory Recording and Syncing
- When a Mystic Voyager writes in their Journey Book, the content is automatically and instantaneously recorded in the Master Journey Tome.
- This includes not just written words, but also sketches, maps, and potentially even emotional impressions or brief flashes of memory associated with the experiences.

#### Master Journey Tome
- The Master Journey Tome is an ancient, perhaps even sentient, artifact held in a secure and sacred location known to the Mystic Voyagers.
- It has an almost infinite capacity, magically expanding to accommodate the influx of new information from all the Journey Books.
- Access to the Master Tome is restricted, available only to high-ranking members of the Wizard of Mystic Voyagers or in special circumstances.

#### Interactive Experience
- Readers of the Master Journey Tome could experience the recorded memories more vividly – as if reliving the experiences themselves. This could be a full sensory experience or a more detached observation, depending on the reader's preference and the Tome's settings.
- This feature allows for a deep and empathetic understanding of the events and experiences recorded.

#### Security and Privacy
- The system ensures that sensitive or private information is safeguarded. Mystic Voyagers have the ability to mark certain entries as private, which would then be encrypted or hidden in the Master Tome.
- There is magical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access or tampering with the contents.

#### Historical and Educational Role
- The Master Journey Tome serves as a living history of the order and its members' adventures, invaluable for educational purposes and for preserving the legacy of the Mystic Voyagers.
- It is a source of wisdom and guidance, with the ability to consult past experiences for insight into current challenges.
