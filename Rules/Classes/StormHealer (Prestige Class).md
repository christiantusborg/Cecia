### Class Features

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: StormHealers gain no additional proficiencies.

**Shocking Aura (Ex)**: Starting at 1st level, you gain a special aura that is always active. You and allies within 10 feet deal an extra 1d2 points of electricity damage on weapon damage rolls. This damage increases as you gain levels in the StormHealer class: to 1d4 at 3rd level, 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 7th level, and 1d10 at 9th level.

**Resistance to Electricity (Ex)**: As you gain levels in this class, you become increasingly resistant to electrical energy. You gain electricity resistance 5 at 1st level, which increases to 10 at 5th level, and 15 at 10th level.

**Lightning Conduit (Su)**: Starting at 2nd level, you can act as a conduit for lightning-based spells or effects. This allows you to redirect any lightning-based spell or effect targeting any creature within 60 feet to yourself as a free action.

**Storm's Vengeful Shield (Ex)**: Starting at 3rd level, you are surrounded by a protective aura of electrical energy that is always active. Whenever you are struck by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d2 points of electricity damage. Additionally, all allies within 10 feet are healed for an amount equal to the electricity damage dealt.

The damage and healing of the shield's passive effect increase as you gain levels in the StormHealer class: to 1d4 at 6th level, 1d6 at 8th level, and 1d8 at 10th level.

**Lightning Healing (Su)**: Starting at 4th level, you can channel the chaotic energy of lightning to heal wounds. You can convert any spell slot into a healing effect as if casting *Cure Moderate Wounds*, but this healing is intense and may cause you to take 1d6 electricity damage for every two levels of StormHealer. You must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid this damage; failure means you take the damage as you convert the chaotic energy into healing magic.

**Wind's Grace (Su)**: At 6th level, you gain a permanent *feather fall* effect and can use *wind wall* as a spell-like ability once per day per StormHealer level.

**Shockwave (Su)**: At 7th level, you can unleash a shockwave of thunderous force as a standard action. This ability deals 5d6 points of sonic damage in a 30-foot cone and pushes creatures back 10 feet if they fail a Reflex save (DC = 10 + your StormHealer level + your Charisma modifier).

**Empowered Healing (Su)**: At 8th level, your lightning healing becomes more potent. You can maximize the healing effects of your Lightning Healing ability, making the healing equivalent to a maximized *Cure Moderate Wounds* spell. After using this ability, you must make a DC 20 Fortitude save. If you fail the save, you take 2d6 points of electricity damage as the chaotic energy backlashes. If you succeed, you avoid the damage.

**Stormlord's Blessing (Su)**: At 9th level, you can call upon Thundar’s favor to protect your allies. Once per day, you can cast *mass cure critical wounds* as a spell-like ability, though doing so automatically deals you 2d6 points of electricity damage.

**Master of the Storm (Su)**: At 10th level, you have become a true master of storm and lightning. You gain immunity to electricity and sonic damage. Additionally, you can call down a *storm of vengeance* once per day as a spell-like ability, and you can empower all your spells and abilities as if under the effect of the *Empower Spell* feat.
