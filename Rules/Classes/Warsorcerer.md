**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Warsorcerer are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, and light shields. At 8th level, a warmage gains proficiency with medium armor (see Armored Mage, below).


## Arcane Infusion (Su)

You may expend a spell slot **before making a roll** to gain a **bonus equal to the slot’s level** to one of the following:

* Attack roll
* Damage roll
* Initiative roll
* Saving throw
* Skill check
* Armor Class (as deflection bonus for 1 round)

**Rules:**

* Declared as a **free action** before the roll or an **immediate action** to react.
* One slot = one roll. You can never split a slot between multiple effects.
* Higher levels increase the number of slots you can use per round.

---

## Arcane Imprint (Su)

At levels 7, 11, 15, and 19, you gain an **Arcane Imprint** by sacrificing a spell slot (2nd level or higher) to gain a **permanent magical enhancement**:

### Choose one:

* **+⌈slot level ÷ 2⌉** to:

  * Attack rolls
  * Damage rolls
  * AC (deflection)
  * Initiative
  * One saving throw
  * One skill
* **+1 inherent bonus** to one ability score

**Rules:**

* The spell slot is permanently lost.
* You may have up to **4** Arcane Imprints.
* Effects are always active.

---

### Arcane Rebinding

You may reassign one imprint by performing a **ritual lasting 1 hour per level** of the new slot used. You regain the old slot and burn a new one.

* One imprint may be changed per 24 hours.

---

##  Armored Mage (Ex)

Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components). A warmage's limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid arcane spell failure as long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium or heavier armors, nor to heavy shields. Nor does this ability apply to spells gained from a different spellcasting class.
At 7th level, a Warsorcerer learns to use medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure.


---

## Bonus Combat Feats

You gain a bonus combat feat at levels: **2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20**. You must meet prerequisites.
