# Vampire
In the world of vampires, there are three main types:

**Regular Vampires (Kindred):** These vampires typically retain varying degrees of their humanity and self-control. They can blend into human society, maintain rational thought, and control their urges to some extent. They often have clans, alliances, and political roles within vampire society, and they can communicate and interact with others through language and negotiation.

**Feral Vampires:** Feral Vampires have succumbed to their inner Beast to such an extent that they have lost most of their humanity and self-control. They behave in a more primal and savage manner, often resembling wild predators. They struggle to maintain self-control, especially in the presence of blood, and are shunned by other vampires due to their dangerous and uncontrollable nature. Their actions are primarily driven by hunger and impulse.

**Vampire Spawn:** Vampire Spawn are created when a vampire drains the blood of a living creature and allows that creature to rise as an undead servant. Unlike full vampires, Vampire Spawn lack the ability to create other Vampire Spawn. They serve their creator as obedient undead minions.
