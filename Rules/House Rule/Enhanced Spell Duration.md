## D&D 3.5 House Rule: Enhanced Spell Duration

### Rule Overview

This house rule modifies the duration of certain spells in D&D 3.5, making them more in line with 3.0 rules, allowing for enhanced spell durations based on caster level.

#### Background

In D&D 3.0, spells like Bull Strength and Cat's Grace provided a longer duration based on caster level, while D&D 3.5 reduced these durations to one minute. This rule aims to find a middle ground, making the durations more balanced and reflective of the caster's power.

#### House Rule
1. **Enhanced Spell Duration**: Under this house rule, spells that provide an Enhancement bonus of +4 to a person's abilities, such as Bull Strength and Cat's Grace, will have a duration equal to the caster's level multiplied by 10 minutes.

2. **Spell List Affected**: 

    - 1. **Bear's Endurance**: This spell enhances the target's Constitution, providing a bonus to Constitution checks, hit points, and Fortitude saves.

    - 2. **Fox's Cunning**: Similar to "Cat's Grace," this spell enhances the target's Intelligence, providing a bonus to Intelligence checks, skill points, and Will saves.

    - 3. **Owl's Wisdom**: Enhances the target's Wisdom, providing a bonus to Wisdom checks, spellcasting, and Will saves.

    - 4. **Eagle's Splendor**: Enhances the target's Charisma, providing a bonus to Charisma checks, social interactions, and Charisma-based spellcasting.

    - 5. **Bull's Strength**: Increases the target's Strength, providing a bonus to Strength checks, melee attack rolls, and damage rolls.

    - 6. **Cat's Grace**: Increases the target's Dexterity, providing a bonus to Dexterity checks, ranged attack rolls, and AC.

    - 7. **Bull's Endurance**: Enhances both the target's Strength and Constitution, providing bonuses to related checks and saves.

    - 8. **Cunning Surge**: Enhances both the target's Intelligence and Dexterity, providing bonuses to related checks and AC.


3. **Caster Level Calculation**: The caster level used to determine the duration is the actual caster level of the spellcaster, not any temporary or modified caster level.

4. **Inherent Balance**: The purpose of this house rule is to enhance gameplay and make these spells more attractive without making them overpowered. It offers a compromise between the 3.0 and 3.5 durations.

#### Rationale

This rule addresses the dissatisfaction with the shortened spell durations in D&D 3.5, providing more versatility and strategic options for players without unbalancing the game. It allows for a more enjoyable and dynamic gaming experience.

#### Implementation

- Game Masters (GMs) should introduce this house rule at the beginning of the campaign or during a session zero discussion.
- The enhanced spell durations should be applied consistently to all relevant spells throughout the campaign.
- Players and GMs should communicate and agree on the implementation of this rule to ensure a fair and balanced game.

By incorporating this house rule, your group can enjoy enhanced spell durations and a more satisfying gaming experience in D&D 3.5.
