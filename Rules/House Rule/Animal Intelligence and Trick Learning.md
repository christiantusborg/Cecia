## D&D 3.5 House Rule: Animal Intelligence and Trick Learning

### Rule Overview

This house rule addresses the learning capabilities of animals in Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, explicitly focusing on animals with low Intelligence scores.

#### Background

In D&D 3.5, animals typically have Intelligence scores of 1 or 2, resulting in a negative Intelligence modifier (-4 or -5). This might suggest that such animals would be capable of learning fewer than three tricks, which contradicts the basic gameplay experience.

#### House Rule

To ensure gameplay balance and realism, the following rule is implemented:

1. **Minimum Trick Learning**: Regardless of their Intelligence modifier, all animals are capable of learning a minimum of three tricks. This rule applies even if the animal has a negative Intelligence modifier due to a low Intelligence score (1 or 2).

2. **Increased Learning for Higher Intelligence**: For animals with Intelligence scores above 2, which is rare for most animal companions or ordinary animals in the game, the number of tricks they can learn increases. Specifically, an animal can learn one additional trick for each point of Intelligence above 2.

#### Rationale

This house rule is designed to balance realism and gameplay mechanics. It acknowledges that even animals with low Intelligence can learn basic commands while rewarding animals with unusually high Intelligence scores.

#### Implementation

- Game Masters (GMs) should apply this rule when determining the capabilities of animal companions or other animals encountered during gameplay.
- This rule is particularly relevant when players interact with, train, or command animals throughout the game.
