## D&D 3.5 House Rule: Daily Recharge of Wands

### Rule Overview

This house rule modifies the mechanics of wand usage in Pathfinder, introducing a daily recharge feature.

#### Background

Wands limited by a set number of charges. Once these charges are used, the wand becomes inert. This rule presents a new approach to how wands regain their charges.

#### House Rule

1. **Daily Charge Replenishment**: Under this house rule, wands will regain a set number of charges each day at dawn. This rule is applied to all wands regardless of their spell level or caster level.

2. **Limitation on Recharges**: To maintain balance, each wand can regain a maximum of 10% of its total charges per day, Minimum one. For example, a wand with 50 total charges can regain up to 5 charges daily.

3. **Fully Depleted Wands**: If a wand's charges are completely depleted, it loses its magical properties and does not benefit from this daily recharge rule.

#### Rationale

This rule is designed to enhance gameplay by allowing more frequent use of wands without overpowering them. It encourages strategic use of wands and resource management, as players must still be mindful of the wand's total charge limit.

#### Implementation

- Game Masters (GMs) should apply this rule at the start of each in-game day, allowing wands in the party's possession to regain charges.
- This rule should be clearly communicated to players at the start of the campaign or when it is introduced.
- GMs may need to adjust encounters and challenges to account for the increased availability of wand-based spells.
