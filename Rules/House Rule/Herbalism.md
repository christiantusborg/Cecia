**Explanation of Table:**
- **Per Active Search Hour:** The quantity of herbs (or the dice type rolled to determine the number) you find during an hour of active searching.
- **Traveling at ½ Speed (Herbs/Time):** The reduced herb collection rate while traveling at half speed due to divided attention.
- **Traveling at Normal Speed (Herbs/Time):** The least efficient method for herb collection as the primary focus is on travel.


## Flexible Point Distribution System for effect


### Example of Distribution:
**1. (d20 + Herbalism):** Let's say the player rolls a total of 32.
**2. Point Distribution:** The player decides how to distribute these 32 points between potency and duration.

#### Example of Distribution:
- The player chooses to use 16 points on potency and the remaining 16 points on duration.

Which means:
- **Potency:** d8
- **Duration:**  15 min

- **Oil:** Moderate effort as it involves pressing or distilling oil from herbs.
- **Dried:** Least effort after fresh herbs, mainly requires time to dry under appropriate conditions.


### Time Required to Create Potions and Pills

Creating a potion or pill involves several steps, including gathering ingredients, preparation, and the actual crafting process. The time it takes can vary based on the complexity of the potion or pill, the quality of ingredients, and the skill level of the crafter. Here's a table that outlines general estimates for the time required to create potions and pills, assuming the crafter has all necessary ingredients and tools at hand.

| Item Type | Complexity | Preparation Time | Crafting Time | Total Time Required |
|-----------|------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Potion    | Simple     | 15 minutes       | 30 minutes    | 45 minutes          |
| Potion    | Moderate   | 30 minutes       | 30 minutes    | 60 minutes          |
| Potion    | Complex    | 60 minutes       | 60 minutes    | 120 minutes         |
| Pill      | Simple     | 30 minutes       | 60 minutes    | 90 minutes          |
| Pill      | Moderate   | 60 minutes       | 60 minutes    | 120 minutes         |
| Pill      | Complex    | 90 minutes       | 90 minutes    | 180 minutes         |

**Notes:**
- **Preparation Time:** Includes gathering tools, preparing ingredients (measuring, grinding, etc.), and setting up the crafting area.
- **Crafting Time:** The actual process of combining ingredients, which may include simmering, distilling, encapsulating, or other methods specific to the potion or pill being made.
- **Total Time Required:** The sum of preparation and crafting time, representing the full investment needed to create the item.

Here's a list of ten rare herbs, each found only in specific areas or under unique conditions, complete with invented names and their special harvesting requirements:

1. **Frostwhisper Bloom**
    - **Location/Circumstance:** his elusive flower is found only in snow-covered areas, emerging exclusively in the morning light. The delicate petals of the Frostwhisper Bloom unfold at the first touch of dawn's early rays, glistening with frost. The blooms can be spotted for just a few hours before they retract and hide beneath the snow once more, making their capture a race against time.
    - **Description:** The Frostwhisper Bloom is a vision of pure winter beauty. Its petals are a translucent blue, edged with a fine dusting of frost that sparkles like tiny diamonds in the morning light. The flower's core emits a soft, ethereal glow, reminiscent of the moon's gentle luminescence on a clear winter night.
2. **Sunfire Petal** **
    - **Location/Circumstance:** The Sunfire Petal reveals itself only when the sun reaches its zenith, absorbing intense heat and sunlight. During these peak hours, the petals shimmer with a fiery glow, visible briefly before the harsh desert conditions cause them to retreat back into the sands.
    - **Description:** The Sunfire Petal burns bright against the desert backdrop, its petals a vibrant mix of gold, orange, and red, mimicking the flames of a fire. When fully open, the flower seems to dance in the heat haze, its edges curling like tongues of flame, casting flickering shadows on the sands below.
3. **Eclipse Shadeleaf**
    - **Location/Circumstance:** This herb hides in the shadowed forests of Nightveil Grove and can only be harvested during a lunar eclipse, under the cover of complete darkness.
    - **Description:** Eclipse Shadeleaf is cloaked in mystery, its leaves a deep, velvety black that absorbs all light. Veins of silver run through each leaf, mirroring the trails of stars across the night sky. During a lunar eclipse, these veins glow softly, providing a stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.
4. **Thundercap Fungi** **
    - **Location/Circumstance:** This unique fungi emerges in places where lightning has previously struck, but only when thunder rumbles through the sky. The presence of a storm seems to awaken the spores, allowing them to absorb and encapsulate the storm's raw energy. The Thundercap Fungi can be found in the aftermath of thunderstorms, glowing faintly with stored electricity.
    - **Description:** Thundercap Fungi bear a rugged appearance, with caps that resemble the tumultuous, dark clouds of a brewing storm. Their surface is a swirling pattern of grey and deep blue, and when agitated, they emit brief sparks, illuminating the fungi with flashes of internal lightning.
5. **Mistveil Mushroom** **
    - **Location/Circumstance:** Found deep within the Misty Marshlands, appearing only when the dense fog that gives the marsh its name is at its thickest, just before dawn.
    - **Description:** Mistveil Mushrooms are enigmatic, with caps that shift in color from a ghostly white to a pale, misty blue. Their stems are slender and slightly translucent, giving them an almost spectral presence. As the morning light filters through the fog, these mushrooms glisten, their surfaces beaded with dew.
6. **Aurora Thistle** **
    - **Location/Circumstance:** This vibrant thistle thrives in wet areas with shallow, still waters. It blooms under specific atmospheric conditions that mimic the visual spectacle of the Aurora Borealis. The petals of the Aurora Thistle shimmer with an array of colors when these unique conditions are met, turning its surroundings into a mesmerizing, luminous display.
    - **Description:** The Aurora Thistle is an aquatic marvel, its long, flowing petals displaying a kaleidoscope of luminous colors. From electric blues to radiant greens, each petal looks painted with the lights of the aurora itself, creating a breathtaking spectacle that lights up the waters around it.
7. **Starlight Sprout** **
    - **Location/Circumstance:** This elusive herb blooms exclusively in open fields under the clear night sky, where the stars are fully visible. The Starlight Sprout harnesses the energy of starlight, revealing itself only on nights when the cosmos is particularly vibrant and clear. Its growth is said to be a rare event, coinciding with nights of exceptional celestial clarity.
    - **Description:** Starlight Sprouts are delicate and ethereal, with slender, silver stems that lead up to tiny, star-shaped blossoms. Each petal is a translucent white, suffused with a soft glow that mirrors the starlight it bathes in, making the plant seem as though it is spun from the very fabric of the night sky.
8. **Wraithroot** **
    - **Location/Circumstance:**  This mysterious root is found in cemeteries, particularly in areas recently traversed by wandering spirits. The Wraithroot is said to emerge from the ground only in spots where these spirits have passed, absorbing the residual essence of their journeys. It becomes visible and harvestable in the eerie silence that follows their visitation.
    - **Description: Wraithroot is hauntingly beautiful, with roots that are a pale, ghostly white and seem to emit a faint, otherworldly glow. The leaves are a deep, sorrowful purple, almost black, and flutter silently in even the slightest breeze, as if whispering secrets to those who dare to listen.
9. **Tideborn Coralweed**
    - **Location/Circumstance:**  This unique aquatic plant can only be found clinging to stones that fall within shadows at noon, when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. The Tideborn Coralweed thrives in these fleeting moments of shade in otherwise sunlit waters, revealing itself only during this precise alignment.
    - **Description:** Tideborn Coralweed is a striking presence in the underwater world, with vibrant, coral-like fronds that range from deep sea blue to bright, sunlit turquoise. Each frond is edged with a thin line of brilliant white, making it stand out starkly against the shadowed rocks it clings to, shimmering softly as the water moves around it.


### Rule for Finding Rare Herbs Through Active Search

#### Active Search Requirement and Difficulty Class (DC) Rule:

**1. Active Search:** Players must explicitly state their intention to search for rare herbs as they traverse the game world. This active search represents the character's focused effort to identify and locate these elusive plants in their specific environments. Passive perception or incidental travel does not suffice to find these herbs.

**2. Difficulty Class (DC) for Herb Foraging:** To successfully locate and harvest a rare herb, players must make a Herbalism check against a **Difficulty Class (DC) of 20.** This reflects the challenge of spotting and safely gathering these plants, given their rare and often protected status in the game world.

**3. Time Investment:** An active search for rare herbs is time-consuming. Each search attempt represents one hour of in-game time, during which the character is assumed to be moving slowly and carefully, examining the area in detail.
    - **Herb Yield Adjustment:** When successfully locating rare herbs through an active search, players will find only half the number of herbs they would typically expect based on the "Herb Searching Outcomes Based on Dice Roll and Activity" table.
**4. Specific Conditions:** Besides the DC check, players must meet the specific conditions listed for each herb, such as the right time of day, specific weather conditions, or the presence of certain celestial or magical phenomena. If the conditions are not met, the herb cannot be found, regardless of the success of the DC check.
