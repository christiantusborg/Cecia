## Herb Searching Outcomes Based on Dice Roll and Activity

**Dice Roll:** The player rolls a d20 and adds their Herbalism skill.

| Dice Roll (d20 + Herbalism) | Per Active Search Hour (Herbs/Hour) | Traveling at ½ Speed (Herbs/Day) | Traveling at Normal Speed (Herbs/Day) |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Less than 5                 | 1                                   | 0                                | 0                                     |

**Explanation of Table:**
- **Per Active Search Hour:** The quantity of herbs (or the dice type rolled to determine the number) you find during an hour of active searching.
- **Traveling at ½ Speed (Herbs/Day):** The reduced herb collection rate while traveling at half speed due to divided attention.
- **Traveling at Normal Speed (Herbs/Day):** The least efficient method for herb collection as the primary focus is on travel.

### Rule for Finding Rare Herbs Through Active Search

### Table 2: Actively Searching for Rare Herbs Outcomes

| Dice Roll (d20 + Herbalism) | Per Active Search Hour (Normal Herbs) | Per Active Search Hour (Rare Herbs) |

#### Active Search for Rare Herbs Requirement and Difficulty Class (DC) Rule:
**1. Active Search Requirement:** Players must declare their intention to actively search for rare herbs while navigating through the game world. This active search denotes the character's concentrated effort to spot and collect these scarce botanicals in their particular habitats. Neither passive observation nor incidental movement is adequate for discovering these herbs.
**2. Difficulty Class (DC) for Herb Foraging:** The effort to successfully find and gather a rare herb is captured by a Herbalism check against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC varies depending on the result of the dice roll as follows:
- For rolls less than 11, rare herbs cannot be found.
- For rolls 11 and higher, the chance to find rare herbs increases, indicating the specialized knowledge and keen observation required to locate such elusive plants.
  **3. Time Investment:** The search for rare herbs is depicted as a meticulous and time-intensive activity. Each search effort represents one hour of in-game time. During this period, the character is considered to be moving at a reduced pace, thoroughly examining their surroundings for these herbs.
  **4. Herb Yield Adjustment for Rare Herbs:** When players successfully locate rare herbs via an active search, the number of herbs found is adjusted based on the outcome of their dice roll, reflecting the difficulty of locating and harvesting these plants. The yield is as follows, indicating that the rarer the herb, the more effort and luck are required to find and gather it:
   - On a roll of 11-15, players find 1 rare herb.
   - On a roll of 16-20, players find up to 2 rare herbs (d2).
   - On a roll of 21-25, players find up to 2 rare herbs (d2).
   - On a roll of 26-30, players find up to 4 rare herbs (d4).
   - On a roll of 31 and above, players find up to 4 rare herbs (d4).
     **5. Specific Conditions:** In addition to the DC check, players must fulfill specific conditions for each herb, such as the correct time of day, particular weather conditions, or the presence of certain celestial or magical phenomena. If these conditions are not met, the herb cannot be discovered, regardless of the dice roll's success.


## Work effort

### Processing Forms, Bonus Values, Requirements, and Work Effort


| Processing Form    | Bonus Value | Required Herbs | Work Effort (Hours) | Herb Potency | Shelf Life     |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Essences/Extracts  | +d8         | 5 herbs        | 4 hours             | 4            | 6 months       |
| Oil                | +d6         | 3 herbs        | 2 hours             | 2            | 3 months       |
| Fresh              | +d4         | 1 herb         | None (0 hours)      | 1            | 5 days         |
| Dried              | +d4         | 2 herbs        | 1 hour              | 1            | 1 year         |


### Explanation:

- **Essences/Extracts:** These are the most refined products, where the active components of herbs are concentrated. This process includes steps that significantly reduce the presence of components that could spoil, making these products last the longest.
- **Oil:** Herbal oils, where herbs are infused into a carrier oil, have a moderate shelf life. The oil protects the active ingredients from oxidation and degradation but not as effectively as the processes used for essences and extracts.
- **Fresh:** Fresh herbs spoil the quickest because they are not processed to extend their shelf life. They can be used in potions or as ingredients in spells but need to be used relatively quickly after collection.
- **Dried:** Drying herbs is a simple preservation technique that significantly extends their usable life. Dried herbs lose their potency over time but at a much slower rate than fresh herbs.



## Time Required to Create Potions and Pills

| Item Type | Base Time (Simple) | Extra Time for Moderate | Extra Time for Complex | Shelf Life  |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Potion    | 45 minutes         | +15 minutes             | +75 minutes            | 1 month     |
| Pill      | 90 minutes         | +30 minutes             | +90 minutes            | 6 months    |

### Notes:

- **Base Time (Simple):** This is the time required to prepare and craft a Simple item, encompassing both preparation and crafting times.
- **Extra Time for Moderate:** This indicates the additional time needed on top of the Base Time for crafting a Moderate complexity item.
   - For Potions: The base time is 45 minutes, with an additional +15 minutes for Moderate complexity, totaling 60 minutes.
   - For Pills: The base time is 90 minutes, with an additional +30 minutes for Moderate complexity, totaling 120 minutes.
- **Extra Time for Complex:** This shows the extra time required beyond the Base Time to craft an item of Complex complexity.
   - For Potions: Starting from the base time of 45 minutes, crafting a Complex potion requires an additional +75 minutes, making the total time 120 minutes.
   - For Pills: With a base time of 90 minutes, crafting a Complex pill requires an extra +90 minutes, totaling 180 minutes.
- **Shelf Life:** Represents how long the crafted item remains effective before losing its potency. Potions, being liquid and potentially more volatile, have a shorter shelf life than pills, which are more stable and last longer due to their solid form and concentrated ingredients.

When you are done with creating the Potion or Pill, then roll "Flexible Point Distribution System Works"

## Flexible Point Distribution System for effect

The flexible point distribution system in this herbalism context allows players to customize the effects of their herbal concoctions based on the total points they accumulate through dice rolls and skill bonuses. This system provides a dynamic way to determine the potency and duration of the herbal effects, offering a nuanced and strategic aspect to herbalism in gameplay. Here's a more detailed explanation with better examples to clarify the process:

### How the Flexible Point Distribution System Works

Players will roll a d20 and add any applicable bonuses from their Herbalism skill and any specific Processing Bonuses from preparing the herbs in various forms, such as essences, oils, etc. The total of these rolls and bonuses gives the player a pool of points to distribute between two key attributes of their concoction: potency and duration.

### Detailed Explanation with Examples

**Step 1: Calculating Total Points**
- For example, if a player rolls a d20 and gets a 16, has a Herbalism skill of 10, and a Processing Bonus of +d8 (rolling a 6), their total points would be 32 (16 + 10 + 6).

**Step 2: Distributing Points Between Potency and Duration**
- The player can then decide how to allocate these 32 points between the potency and duration of their concoction's effect. This step requires strategic thinking, as the allocation will directly impact the effectiveness and longevity of the concoction's effects.

**Improved Examples of Distribution:**

1. **Balanced Approach:** The player decides to evenly distribute points, placing 16 points on potency and 16 points on duration. This results in a concoction with moderate potency and duration, suitable for situations where both immediate impact and lasting effects are desirable.
   - **Outcome:** Potency is determined by a d6 (based on the 16-20 points bracket for potency), and the duration is 10 minutes (as per the 16-20 points bracket for duration).

2. **Potency-Focused Approach:** The player allocates more points to potency than to duration, say 22 points to potency and 10 points to duration. This strategy is useful when the player needs a strong effect that acts quickly but doesn't need to last long.
   - **Outcome:** Potency is determined by a d8 (based on the 21-25 points bracket for potency), and the duration is 1 minute (as per the 5-10 points bracket for duration).

3. **Duration-Focused Approach:** Conversely, the player might decide that a longer-lasting effect is more important, allocating 25 points to duration and 7 points to potency. This approach is ideal for effects that need to be sustained over a longer period, albeit with less intensity.
   - **Outcome:** Potency does not receive a bonus because it falls under the less than 5 points category, and the duration is 15 minutes (as per the 21-25 points bracket for duration).

These examples illustrate the flexibility and strategic depth the point distribution system adds to the gameplay, allowing players to tailor their herbal concoctions to fit their specific needs or strategies in various situations.

## Crafting Example Mechanics

Imagine a player wants to craft an item that requires a total Herb Cost (potency) of 8. They can choose to meet this requirement using any combination of processed herbs, as long as the total potency adds up to 8. The highest "Bonus Value" among the chosen ingredients will determine the extra benefits of the final product.

Let's go through some examples of options:

1. **Using 1 Essence/Extract and 2 Oil:**
   - **Essence/Extract:** Provides a potency of 4 and a bonus value of +d8.
   - **Oil (x2):** Each provides a potency of 2 (for a total of 4) and a bonus value of +d6.
   - **Total Potency:** 4 (Essence/Extract) + 4 (Oil x2) = 8.
   - **Applied Bonus Value:** +d8 (from Essence/Extract), since it's the highest among the ingredients.

2. **Using 1 Essence/Extract and 4 Dried:**
   - **Essence/Extract:** Offers a potency of 4 and a bonus value of +d8.
   - **Dried (x4):** Each provides a potency of 1 (for a total of 4) and a bonus value of +d4.
   - **Total Potency:** 4 (Essence/Extract) + 4 (Dried x4) = 8.
   - **Applied Bonus Value:** +d8 (from Essence/Extract).

3. **Using 1 Oil and 6 Dried:**
   - **Oil:** Provides a potency of 2 and a bonus value of +d6.
   - **Dried (x6):** Each offers a potency of 1 (for a total of 6) and a bonus value of +d4.
   - **Total Potency:** 2 (Oil) + 6 (Dried x6) = 8.
   - **Applied Bonus Value:** +d6 (from Oil), since it's the highest among the ingredients.

3. **Using 2 Fresh and 6 Dried:**
   - **Fresh (x2):** Each offers a potency of 1 (for a total of 2) and a bonus value of +d4.
   - **Dried (x6):** Each offers a potency of 1 (for a total of 6) and a bonus value of +d4.
   - **Total Potency:** 2 (Fresh x6) + 6 (Dried x6) = 8.
   - **Applied Bonus Value:** +d4 (from Fresh or Dried), since it's the highest among the ingredients.



### Table of Skill Groups, Included Skills, and Adjusted Herb Costs
To adjust the complexity levels to a simpler schema of Simple, Moderate, and Complex, the table can be updated accordingly. This streamlined approach allows for an easier understanding and application within gameplay, particularly in role-playing settings like Dungeons & Dragons.

Here's a list of ten rare herbs, each found only in specific areas or under unique conditions, complete with invented names and their special harvesting requirements:

1. **Frostwhisper Bloom**
   - **Location/Circumstance:** his elusive flower is found only in snow-covered areas, emerging exclusively in the morning light. The delicate petals of the Frostwhisper Bloom unfold at the first touch of dawn's early rays, glistening with frost. The blooms can be spotted for just a few hours before they retract and hide beneath the snow once more, making their capture a race against time.
   - **Description:** The Frostwhisper Bloom is a vision of pure winter beauty. Its petals are a translucent blue, edged with a fine dusting of frost that sparkles like tiny diamonds in the morning light. The flower's core emits a soft, ethereal glow, reminiscent of the moon's gentle luminescence on a clear winter night.
2. **Sunfire Petal** **
   - **Location/Circumstance:** The Sunfire Petal reveals itself only when the sun reaches its zenith, absorbing intense heat and sunlight. During these peak hours, the petals shimmer with a fiery glow, visible briefly before the harsh desert conditions cause them to retreat back into the sands.
   - **Description:** The Sunfire Petal burns bright against the desert backdrop, its petals a vibrant mix of gold, orange, and red, mimicking the flames of a fire. When fully open, the flower seems to dance in the heat haze, its edges curling like tongues of flame, casting flickering shadows on the sands below.
3. **Eclipse Shadeleaf**
   - **Location/Circumstance:** This herb hides in the shadowed forests of Nightveil Grove and can only be harvested during a lunar eclipse, under the cover of complete darkness.
   - **Description:** Eclipse Shadeleaf is cloaked in mystery, its leaves a deep, velvety black that absorbs all light. Veins of silver run through each leaf, mirroring the trails of stars across the night sky. During a lunar eclipse, these veins glow softly, providing a stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.
4. **Thundercap Fungi** **
   - **Location/Circumstance:** This unique fungi emerges in places where lightning has previously struck, but only when thunder rumbles through the sky. The presence of a storm seems to awaken the spores, allowing them to absorb and encapsulate the storm's raw energy. The Thundercap Fungi can be found in the aftermath of thunderstorms, glowing faintly with stored electricity.
   - **Description:** Thundercap Fungi bear a rugged appearance, with caps that resemble the tumultuous, dark clouds of a brewing storm. Their surface is a swirling pattern of grey and deep blue, and when agitated, they emit brief sparks, illuminating the fungi with flashes of internal lightning.
5. **Mistveil Mushroom** **
   - **Location/Circumstance:** Found deep within the Misty Marshlands, appearing only when the dense fog that gives the marsh its name is at its thickest, just before dawn.
   - **Description:** Mistveil Mushrooms are enigmatic, with caps that shift in color from a ghostly white to a pale, misty blue. Their stems are slender and slightly translucent, giving them an almost spectral presence. As the morning light filters through the fog, these mushrooms glisten, their surfaces beaded with dew.
6. **Aurora Thistle** **
   - **Location/Circumstance:** This vibrant thistle thrives in wet areas with shallow, still waters.

7. **Starlight Sprout** **
   - **Location/Circumstance:** This elusive herb blooms exclusively in open fields under the clear night sky, where the stars are fully visible.

Its growth is said to be a rare event, coinciding with nights of exceptional celestial clarity.
   - **Description:** Starlight Sprouts are delicate and ethereal, with slender, silver stems that lead up to tiny, star-shaped blossoms.

8. **Wraithroot** **
   - **Location/Circumstance:**  This mysterious root is found in cemeteries, particularly in areas recently traversed by wandering spirits.

It becomes visible and harvestable in the eerie silence that follows their visitation.
   - **Description: Wraithroot is hauntingly beautiful, with roots that are a pale, ghostly white and seem to emit a faint, otherworldly glow. The leaves are a deep, sorrowful purple, almost black, and flutter silently in even the slightest breeze, as if whispering secrets to those who dare to listen.
9. **Tideborn Coralweed**
   - **Location/Circumstance:**  This unique aquatic plant can only be found clinging to stones that fall within shadows at noon, when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. The Tideborn Coralweed thrives in these fleeting moments of shade in otherwise sunlit waters, revealing itself only during this precise alignment.
   - **Description:** Tideborn Coralweed is a striking presence in the underwater world, with vibrant, coral-like fronds that range from deep sea blue to bright, sunlit turquoise. Each frond is edged with a thin line of brilliant white, making it stand out starkly against the shadowed rocks it clings to, shimmering softly as the water moves around it.
     Certainly, let's adjust the Veilroot Ivy's details to match the requested length:
10. **Veilroot Ivy**
   - **Location/Circumstance:** Veilroot Ivy exclusively adorns the Stonebark Oak, a tree found in ancient forests, only during the leaf fall season. This rare ivy requires the unique conditions of autumn to thrive, when the leaves of the Stonebark Oak begin to tumble, signaling the ivy's peak potency. Its harvest is a race against time, as it must be collected precisely when the leaves fall, capturing the essence of transition and endurance.
   - **Description:** With leaves of deep, verdant green that contrast against the oak's grey, stone-like bark, Veilroot Ivy is both beautiful and resilient. Its leaves, glowing faintly as the daylight wanes, mark the perfect moment for harvesting. This luminescence, a sign of the ivy's readiness, casts a mystical light on the forest floor, making the Stonebark Oak and its ivy a beacon of ancient strength and magic.
