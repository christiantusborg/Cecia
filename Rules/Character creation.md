**Baseline Scores:** In the Cecia D&D 3.5 point-buy system, you start with a set of baseline ability scores, typically all at 10, which represents the average for a human.

**Point Allocation:** You are given a pool of points to distribute among your ability scores. In Cecia D&D 3.5, the typical point pool is 28 points, but this can vary based on the Dungeon Master's or campaign's rules.

**Cost of Ability Scores:**
| Score Range  | Point Cost |
|--------------|------------|
| 6            | +4         |
| 8            | +2         |
| 9            | +1         |
| 10           | 0          |
| 10 -> 11     | -1         |
| 11 -> 12     | -1         |
| 12 -> 13     | -1         |
| 13 -> 14     | -1         |
| 14 -> 15     | -2         |
| 15 -> 16     | -2         |
| 16 -> 17     | -4         |
| 17 -> 18     | -4         |


**Race Bonuses:** In Cecia D&D 3.5, many races have inherent bonuses to certain ability scores. For example, Dwarves often get a bonus to Constitution and a penalty to Charisma. When creating a character, you apply these race bonuses or penalties to the ability scores after you've completed the point allocation. Race bonuses are added directly to the relevant ability scores, and penalties are subtracted.
