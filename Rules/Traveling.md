## Traveling Speed and Distance on Foot per Hour/Terrain

### Speed per Hour:
On flat and clear terrain: Approximately 5 to 6.5 kilometers per hour.

#### Distance per Day:

**On flat and clear terrain:** Roughly 24 to 40 kilometers, assuming 6 to 8 hours of travel.
For different terrain types, the distances would vary:

Dirt Roads and Paths: Similar to flat terrain, but could be slower if the road was in poor condition. Approximately 4 to 5 kilometers per hour, totaling about 20 to 32 kilometers per day.

**Fields and Farmlands:** Travel might be slightly slower due to uneven ground. Around 3.5 to 5 kilometers per hour, leading to 18 to 30 kilometers per day.

**Forests and Woodlands:** Dense vegetation and uneven terrain could reduce speed to 3 to 4 kilometers per hour, with a daily distance of 15 to 25 kilometers.

**Hills and Mountains:** Steep and difficult paths would significantly reduce speed to 2 to 3 kilometers per hour, with daily distances of 10 to 18 kilometers.

**Rivers and Streams:** Travel along rivers might be faster if following a path, but crossing them could slow progress. Speeds and distances would be similar to those of dirt roads and fields.

**Villages and Towns:** Slightly faster travel might be possible on well-maintained roads, around 4 to 6 kilometers per hour, with a daily distance of 20 to 35 kilometers.

**Marshes and Wetlands:** Very challenging terrain, potentially reducing speed to 2 to 3 kilometers per hour, with daily distances of less than 15 kilometers.

These are general estimates and actual travel times could vary significantly based on specific conditions and the individual traveler.


## Speed and Distance on Horseback per Terrain
Traveling by wagon in the Middle Ages would be slower than on horseback, largely due to the limitations of the wagon itself and the roads available. Here are some general estimates in kilometers:

Speed per Hour:

On flat and clear terrain, a wagon, typically pulled by oxen or horses, might move at a pace of about 3 to 5 kilometers per hour. This speed would be influenced by the quality of the wagon, the strength of the animals, and the weight of the load.
Distance per Day:

On flat and clear terrain, a wagon could cover about 20 to 30 kilometers in a day. This assumes a travel day of around 6 to 8 hours, considering the need for rest breaks for both the animals and the travelers.
For different terrain types, the distances and speeds would vary:

Dirt Roads and Paths: Similar to flat terrain, but potentially slower if the road was in poor condition, possibly 2 to 4 kilometers per hour, totaling about 15 to 25 kilometers per day.

Fields and Farmlands: Uneven ground and the need to navigate around obstacles could reduce the speed to 2 to 3 kilometers per hour, leading to 12 to 20 kilometers per day.

Forests and Woodlands: Dense vegetation and uneven terrain could reduce speed further, perhaps to 1.5 to 3 kilometers per hour, with a daily distance of 10 to 18 kilometers.

Hills and Mountains: Steep and difficult paths would significantly reduce speed and might even make passage impossible for wagons in some areas. If passable, the speed could drop to 1 to 2 kilometers per hour, with daily distances of less than 15 kilometers.

Rivers and Streams: Crossing rivers could be particularly challenging for wagons and might require ferries or well-maintained bridges.

Villages and Towns: Travel might be slightly faster on better roads, around 3 to 5 kilometers per hour, with a daily distance of 20 to 30 kilometers.

Marshes and Wetlands: Often impassable for wagons. If passable, the speed would be very slow, less than 2 kilometers per hour.

These estimates are general and actual travel times could vary significantly based on specific conditions, the type of wagon, the animals used, and the weight of the load.

## Speed and Distance of a River Barge

Traveling by river barge in the Middle Ages was a common and efficient way to move both people and goods, especially for long distances or when transporting heavy or bulky items. The speed and distance covered would vary based on the river's current, the weather, and the type of barge. Here are some general estimates in kilometers:

Speed per Hour:

The speed of a river barge would largely depend on the flow of the river. Going downstream, with the current, a barge could travel at about 3 to 5 kilometers per hour. Upstream travel would be slower, around 1 to 3 kilometers per hour, depending on the strength of the current and whether the barge was being towed or propelled by poles.
Distance per Day:

Given these speeds, a barge could cover approximately 30 to 50 kilometers downstream in a day. Upstream, the distance would be less, likely around 10 to 25 kilometers, depending on the method of propulsion and the river's current.
For different types of rivers and conditions, the distances would vary:

Large Rivers with Strong Currents: Traveling downstream on large rivers like the Rhine or the Danube would be faster, potentially exceeding 5 kilometers per hour. Upstream travel would be more challenging and slower.

Smaller Rivers or Those with Milder Currents: These would offer more moderate speeds both downstream and upstream.

Rivers with Locks or Weirs: These could slow down travel significantly, as the barge would need to navigate these structures, which could be time-consuming.

Weather Conditions: Strong winds or storms could hinder progress, especially when traveling upstream.

River barges in the Middle Ages were vital for trade and transportation, as they could carry much larger loads than wagons and were generally more efficient for long-distance transport, especially for heavy or bulky goods.


## Speed and Distance of Small Boat Near Shore
Traveling by small boat near the shore during the Middle Ages would depend on the type of boat, weather conditions, and the nature of the coastline. Here's an overview in kilometers:

Speed per Hour:

Small boats, such as rowboats or small sailing vessels, could travel at varying speeds. Rowboats might move at about 3 to 5 kilometers per hour, depending on the strength and skill of the rowers. Small sailing boats could travel faster, potentially reaching speeds of 5 to 10 kilometers per hour with favorable winds.
Distance per Day:

Considering a travel day of about 6 to 8 hours, a rowboat could cover approximately 18 to 40 kilometers, while a small sailing boat could cover 30 to 80 kilometers in a day, depending on wind conditions and the skill of the sailor.
For different coastal conditions, the distances and speeds would vary:

Calm Seas: In calm conditions, both rowboats and small sailing boats could achieve their maximum speeds.

Rough Waters: Choppy waters or strong currents could significantly slow down a small boat, especially a rowboat, or even make travel dangerous.

Coastal Features: Navigating around headlands, through narrow straits, or in shallow waters could also impact speed and distance.

Weather Conditions: Favorable winds would aid sailing boats, but adverse weather, like storms or strong crosswinds, could hinder progress or force the boat to seek shelter.

Navigation and Safety: Coastal navigation in the Middle Ages was more challenging and risky than it is today, so travel might be slower due to caution, especially in unfamiliar or hazardous areas.

Small boats were commonly used for fishing, short-range trade, or travel between coastal settlements. The distances and speeds mentioned are general estimates and could vary significantly based on the specific boat, conditions, and the skill of the sailors.


## Speed and Distance of a Boat in Open Sea

Traveling by boat in the open sea during the Middle Ages presents a different set of variables compared to coastal or river travel. The type of sea-going vessel, weather conditions, and navigation skills are critical factors. Here are some general estimates in kilometers:

Speed per Hour:

Sea-going vessels in the Middle Ages, like cogs and caravels, could travel at varying speeds depending on their design, size, and the wind conditions. A typical speed might be around 5 to 8 kilometers per hour under favorable wind conditions.
Distance per Day:

Assuming favorable winds and a continuous journey without stops, these ships could cover approximately 120 to 190 kilometers in a 24-hour period. This calculation assumes the ship is sailing day and night, which was common in favorable weather.
For different sea conditions, the distances and speeds would vary:

Favorable Winds: With strong and consistent tailwinds, a ship could reach the higher end of its speed range and cover more distance in a day.

Adverse Winds or No Wind: Headwinds, crosswinds, or periods of calm with no wind at all could significantly reduce speed, or even halt progress entirely.

Rough Seas: Heavy seas could make sailing dangerous and slow progress, as ships would need to navigate cautiously.

Navigation: Navigational challenges in the open sea could affect the distance covered. Without modern navigation tools, medieval sailors often relied on dead reckoning and celestial navigation, which could be imprecise.

Type of Vessel: Larger, more robust ships like galleons would be slower but more stable in rough seas, while smaller, lighter ships could be faster but less sturdy.

Sea travel in the Middle Ages was a complex undertaking, subject to the mercy of the weather and sea conditions. The distances and speeds mentioned are general estimates and could vary significantly based on the specific ship, conditions, and the skill of the crew.


## Longboat Row Speed

Longboats, known for their speed and maneuverability, were rowed when sailing was not possible or to gain additional speed. Here's an overview of their rowing speed:

Speed per Hour:

Viking longboats could be quite fast when rowed. They might reach speeds of around 5 to 7 kilometers per hour. This speed could vary depending on the number and strength of the rowers, the size of the boat, and the water conditions.
Factors Influencing Speed:

Number of Rowers: Viking longboats varied in size, with larger ones having more oars. More rowers meant more power and potentially higher speed.
Rowers' Strength and Stamina: The physical condition and rowing skill of the crew would significantly affect the speed.
Boat Design: Viking longboats were designed to be efficient and fast, both when rowing and sailing. Their slender, long design helped them move swiftly through the water.
Water Conditions: Calm waters would allow for faster speeds, while rough or choppy conditions could slow the boat down.
The Viking longboat was an exceptional vessel for its time, capable of both deep-sea voyages and navigating shallower rivers and estuaries, thanks to its unique design and construction.

## Speed and Distance of a Caravan with Horses
Traveling by a caravan with horses during the Middle Ages, the speed and distance covered per day would depend on several factors such as the number of horses, the weight of the load, the condition of the roads, and the terrain. Here are some general estimates:

Speed per Hour:

A caravan of horses, typically moving at a walking pace to accommodate the load and ensure the safety of the goods and animals, might travel at about 3 to 4 kilometers per hour.
Distance per Day:

Considering the need for rest stops for both the animals and the people, and assuming a travel day of about 6 to 8 hours, a horse-drawn caravan could cover approximately 18 to 32 kilometers in a day.
For different terrain types, the distances and speeds would vary:

Dirt Roads and Paths: On average, the caravan would maintain a pace of about 3 to 4 kilometers per hour.

Fields and Farmlands: Traversing uneven farmland terrain might slow the caravan slightly.

Forests and Woodlands: Dense vegetation and uneven terrain could further reduce speed.

Hills and Mountains: Steep paths would significantly slow the caravan, possibly reducing the speed to below 3 kilometers per hour.

Rivers and Streams: Crossing water bodies could be time-consuming and might require detours to find suitable crossing points.

Villages and Towns: Passage through populated areas might be quicker if the roads were better maintained.

Marshes and Wetlands: These terrains would be challenging and might be largely impassable for caravans.

These are broad estimates. Actual travel times could vary significantly based on specific conditions and the composition of the caravan.

## Speed and Distance of a Caravan with Oxen
Traveling by a caravan with oxen during the Middle Ages, the speed and distance covered per day would generally be slower compared to horses, as oxen move at a more deliberate pace. Here are some estimates:

Speed per Hour:

A caravan pulled by oxen would typically travel at a slow, steady pace, approximately 2 to 3 kilometers per hour. Oxen are slower than horses but can pull heavier loads and are more suited for rough terrain.
Distance per Day:

Considering the need for rest stops for both the animals and the people, and assuming a travel day of about 6 to 8 hours, an ox-drawn caravan could cover around 12 to 24 kilometers in a day.
The speeds and distances for different terrain types would vary:

Dirt Roads and Paths: The caravan would maintain a steady but slow pace, likely closer to 2 kilometers per hour.

Fields and Farmlands: Traversing uneven farmland terrain might not significantly alter the speed of oxen, given their strength and steady pace.

Forests and Woodlands: The dense vegetation and uneven terrain could slightly reduce the speed.

Hills and Mountains: Steep paths would slow the caravan considerably. Oxen are strong and can manage slopes, but at a reduced speed.

Rivers and Streams: Crossing water bodies could be challenging and time-consuming, requiring careful navigation.

Villages and Towns: Travel through populated areas might be slightly quicker if the roads were better, but the overall pace would still be dictated by the oxen.

Marshes and Wetlands: These terrains would be difficult, potentially slowing the caravan to a crawl or making it impassable.

Oxen were often preferred for heavy loads and long journeys where endurance and strength were more important than speed. The estimates given are general and actual travel times could vary based on specific conditions and the specifics of the caravan.

## Speed of a Forced March

A forced march typically refers to a rapid movement, often undertaken by military units, with the aim of covering a significant distance in a short period. The speed and distance of a forced march can vary depending on several factors such as the fitness and training of the individuals, the terrain, the weather, and the burden carried. Here's an overview:

Speed:

During a forced march, the speed can be significantly higher than normal travel. For infantry, this could mean marching at speeds up to 6 to 8 kilometers per hour. However, maintaining this pace for an extended period is challenging and physically demanding.
Distance per Day:

A typical forced march could cover distances of 40 to 50 kilometers in a day, although highly trained and motivated troops could potentially cover more, especially in emergency situations or when the need for rapid movement is critical.
Factors influencing a forced march:

Terrain: Rough or uneven terrain, like mountains or dense forests, would slow down a forced march considerably.

Weather Conditions: Adverse weather, such as heavy rain or extreme heat, could impede progress and increase the physical strain on the individuals.

Load Carried: The weight of equipment, supplies, and personal gear would affect the speed and distance achievable. Lightly equipped units could move faster and farther.

Training and Fitness: The physical condition and training of the individuals are crucial. Well-trained, fit troops can maintain a faster pace for longer periods.

Morale and Motivation: High morale and a clear understanding of the importance of the march can motivate troops to endure the physical strain.

Discipline and Organization: Effective leadership and organization are key to maintaining the pace and direction of the march.

Forced marches are demanding and can lead to exhaustion, increased risk of injury, and decreased combat effectiveness if not managed carefully. They are typically used in military contexts where speed is crucial to achieving strategic objectives.

## Horseback Messenger (Similar to Pony Express)
For long-distance messengers on horseback, similar in concept to the Pony Express, the speed and distance covered would be maximized for urgent delivery. These messengers would typically change horses at regular intervals to maintain a fast pace. Here's a simplified overview:

Speed per Hour:

A messenger riding at a brisk pace could average speeds of about 12 to 15 kilometers per hour. This pace balances speed with the need to avoid over-exerting the horse.
Distance per Day:

With multiple horse changes and minimal stops, a messenger could cover approximately 120 to 160 kilometers in a day. This estimation assumes extended hours of travel, beyond the typical 6 to 8 hours.
Key Factors:

Horse Changes: Regularly changing horses at designated stations would allow the messenger to maintain a fast pace without exhausting any single horse.

Road/Trail Quality: Better quality roads or trails would enable faster travel.

Weather and Terrain: Adverse weather and challenging terrain would slow down the journey.

Light Load: Messengers would carry only essential items to minimize weight and maximize speed.

Endurance and Skill of the Rider: The rider's ability to manage different horses and navigate varying terrains and conditions would be crucial.

This mode of operation was effective for rapid communication over long distances before modern transportation and communication methods. The Pony Express is a famous historical example, where riders changed horses approximately every 15 to 20 miles to keep up a fast and consistent pace across the American West.
